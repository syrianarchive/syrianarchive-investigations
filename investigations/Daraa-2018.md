## De-escalation zone

In May 2017, Russia, [Turkey and Iran signed a memorandum of understanding for the establishment of de-escalation zones in Syria](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5cF-gIL8yzk&sa=D&ust=1540401260470000), which included Idlib province, some parts of the provinces of Latakia, Hama, and Aleppo, as well as some parts of northern Homs, Eastern Ghouta in Damascus countryside, Daraa and Quneitra cities south of Syria.

Although the area is part of the de-escalation zone; Assad regime's forces launched a military campaign against the eastern countryside of Daraa, including an attack on the Medical center of Busra al-Harir. The town of [Busra al-Harir is located 90 km southeast of the capital, Damascus](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/VQz9XEU6qSS2&sa=D&ust=1540401260470000), and considered strategically important for its proximity to the international highway.

On June 24, 2018, at 14:16 pm, a pro-Syrian government network published a map of control and influence [showing the strategic location of Busra al-Harir town](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/Manqolmain/photos/a.139275016166461/1777805855646694/?type%3D3%26theater&sa=D&ust=1540401260472000) for the armed opposition forces.

Several news networks reported [shelling of Busra al-Harir town by warplanes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/SyriaNewsKit/posts/2091692427715370&sa=D&ust=1540401260472000), as well as [dropping barrel bombs on the town by regime helicopters](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/SyriaNewsKit/posts/2091692604382019&sa=D&ust=1540401260473000) on the morning of June 24.

A video was circulated by activists [showing a MiG flying in a low altitude over Busra al-Harir town](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/tunza.santhong/posts/1112941155513047&sa=D&ust=1540401260473000), this video was published at 14:44 pm, on June 24.

After scrutiny, the Research Team in the Syrian Archive concluded that the aircraft shown in the video was a MiG-23.

MiG 23 - [Source](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-23&sa=D&ust=1540401260475000)

The research team in Syrian Archive consider likely that the aircraft was operated by the Syrian air force, since Russia no longer uses the MiG-23, while it is still widely used by the Syrian air force.
[This link contains](https://www.scramble.nl/orbats/syria/airforce) Information about MiG-23 ML, its use by the Syrian Air Force, and the most important military airports of the Syrian regime. We note that the nearest airports to the impact site are Khalkhaleh military airport in As-Suwayda' countryside and Marj Rahil airport; which both contain MiG-23 ML aircraft.

![](/assets/investigations/Daraa2018/image24.png)

[Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM)](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.uossm.org/&sa=D&ust=1540401260483000), the organization supporting the hospital, was founded in January 2012 in France; it aims to provide medical care to Syrians in Syria and the asylum countries as well as supply full medical support including medicines, medical consumables, and training of medical personnel.

Nabaa news agency also published pictures from Daraa [showing the exposure of UOSSM primary health care center](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nabaa-sy.com/2018/06/25/%25D8%25A8%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25B5%25D9%2588%25D8%25B1-%25D8%25AE%25D8%25B1%25D9%2588%25D8%25AC-%25D9%2585%25D8%25B4%25D9%2581%25D9%2589-%25D8%25A8%25D8%25B5%25D8%25B1-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25AD%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D8%25B1-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2585%25D9%258A%25D8%25AF%25D8%25A7%25D9%2586%25D9%258A-%25D8%25B9/&sa=D&ust=1540401260484000) in Busra al-Harir to intensive air raids. The following pictures are from Nabaa news agency:

In the following picture; the logo of UOSSM medical organization can be seen, confirming that it is the sponsor of this hospital.

Although currently sponsored by UOSSM, Busra al-Harir medical center [was established on 15 November 2009 as "Family Medical center](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bosrharir.reefnet.sy/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D414:2009-11-15-15-19-13%26catid%3D2:2009-02-14-07-40-41&sa=D&ust=1540401260490000)" by the Syrian government.

When matching the photos, we can confirm that the center bombed in 2018 is the same one established in 2009.

The two main entrances, the gate, and its color are consistent features of the hospital shown in older and more recent photos.

Given the hospital's history in the region, an activist published a post on Facebook, at 17:53, stating that [air raids launched by Russian warplanes on Busra al-Harir field hospital took it out of service](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/galal.altellawi.9/posts/481411515648473&sa=D&ust=1540401260486000). Alongside corroborating that an attack ooccurred on the hospital, this post additionally confirms the UOSSM report that the attack occurred around 17:00. 

At 19:42, the Houran News network published a [picture of the hospital and damages sustained by bombing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/2187202808178227/photos/basw.Abr-fU4rGblz8LrJf9GVbFThACmbg0rtGdnZ8forn1xfcs_yi55GZz-PClAJcAnBX5WiJ-JbBDOJdEEj9jdAg2XJoSjJQ44tUtLsPazIsyixH_JvhY_cQONpQGX3Je9a-pmDH6UOaDNg9nnkdPrLcMf3n3SGm-kunPhQPnqX6uWmfRgp_C-1x32a8FMDPN5JjZD5UWXMwlrpLeeoJjVwGcqc_xtbk-LfIoIpta9i9bdNeLXco1puzmZxRJolIsLo85W8dtj1hA0HYLEJ0HeKKmFY.735360299815375.367163090110166.2187370148161493.582531632131153.619958388388477.619958341721815.619371565113826.619957195055263.662948727422776/2187370148161493/?type%3D1%26opaqueCursor%3DAbojCcXk7J2K-fK1j7PQE7l5z85HvJ0ER4X2R41yQptUimE56Ffcsp8nSEaGCSe9L-BiidDxjLZ2NT7rA062t2B1fMZcy-xvQERz3nhKPkmg2nPOtiabd8nguOGwjUay55CHYihKfynGyQaNWAeRzH5E_tMbLUFRYDN2i90oLmb4rIBuDdsrwis74915nHNGDUvHls0_1L1IwNGisA3uHYePkiJ6oRt6Mc7VLtmgQOoMyMEmQ7chSxBl0Dtx6i1jINpWD_SDPfl70b1HmgsG6D8QsKr2m6Ys3lDwuE8BY0bZMtlrFvhd3Ys9p8Ihq_xljpDf8LS8q3PmOSZZUMvRqG4bsgtC3AVCLzYMXxMxvp0UMPqlV01HaLPItDc63U-k2M58O2Gown9v2xoQsf9HCyWzwrvETz79JGoZGSTLcvjY-DTZqhOqICMrViC2qOIg8PhmD2b_nGEWl3waiawUlpgiH2pfLsyXv2kKi9-EOPD8-pB9EGhlHoNtSDRloNacb0FeoYrH0DZMt-1vuwWoiLjAiMpI7nAetKFDfrucrS734Wq_KD6oqc27dKtTXxwO57pPNTPQcXNFKK4uCv6mujDhu5D6yXjEV5Kl1YZPR16tI7sHmM5xNDeKwvc9RmdU2lwLREloVGJdCLBFeLrHSzT5Zxf5cQdmN-zo_Yrf1ENX1FLSBIRBYEScaupPaqnkn5I&sa=D&ust=1540401260488000).

At 21:16, one of the news networks reported that [Russian warplanes targeted Busra al-Harir hospital with heavy shelling](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/Syrian.watchers/posts/274610629752674&sa=D&ust=1540401260490000), which preceded the targeting of Al-Harak Hospital. Both medical facilities were noted as put out of service.

### Geolocating the attacked site

Al-Jazeera TV published a video on 1 August 2015 [showing a tour of Busra al-Harir town on the highway](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DlrD4rY0nCS4&sa=D&ust=1540401260493000) near a complex of schools followed by the health center.
