## Introduction

Several days after intense shelling in the Daraa govenorate that began on Tuesday June 19,2018, Syrian government forces launched an offensive, on June 23, against armed opposition strongholds in the southwestern province. According to activists and open source media, regime helicopters dropped more than eight barrel bombs on towns in the province on June 23 and 24. According to [Radio Rozana](https://www.rozana.fm/en/about-us), an "independent, politically and non-religiouslly affiliated" news organization, Russian warplanes launched [heavy raids](https://www.rozana.fm/ar/news/2018/06/24/%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%AB%D9%91%D9%81-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AE%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF) on areas under opposition faction control in Daraa for the first time in a year after a Russian agreement to a ceasefire in the region. This investigation focuses upon attacks on 3 vital facilities in Busra Al Harir and Al Musayfirah during this campaign limiting civilian access to medical care. 

### Methodology
Syrian Archive conducted an investigation into the incident, based on three steps:

(1) A local investigation’s team collected testimonies from eye-witnesses or those who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the airstrike; 
(2) Securing, analysing, and verifying of 47 videos and images uploaded to social media networks purportedly showing the incident; 
(3) The combined analysis of these sources has culminated in the present investigation report. Complementing each other, they provide information regarding the attack’s date and time, location, casualties, and extent of damage.

Examining all information available on the attack, the investigations’ team developed an understanding of the incident and potential perpetrators.

For more details on Syrian Archive’s Methodology, please see our [website](https://syrianarchive.org/en/tools_methods/methodology/).

## De-escalation zone

A year prior to the attack on Busra Al Harir and Al Musayfirah, in May 2017, Russia, Turkey, and Iran signed a [memorandum of understanding establishing de-escalation zones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5cF-gIL8yzk&sa=D&ust=1540401260470000) in Syria where hostilities would be halted. These zones included the entire Idlib governorate, some parts of the provinces of Latakia, Hama, and Aleppo, as well as some parts of northern Homs, Eastern Ghouta in the Damascus countryside, and the cities of Daraa and Quneitra in southern Syria.

Although included and established as a zone with little to no hostility, Eastern Daraa faced a military campaign by Russian and Syrian government forces Syrian government forces, which included an attack on vital centers in Busra al-Harir and Al Musayfirah. 

## Background
The town of [Busra Al Harir is located 90 km southeast of the capital, Damascus](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/VQz9XEU6qSS2&sa=D&ust=1540401260470000), and is considered strategically important because of its proximity to the M5, a highway which runs from Jordan through Damascus and Homs to Aleppo.

Although only estimating, [LiveUAMap](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/time/23.06.2018), an interactive mapping tool which shows major events and areas of control in Syria, reveals the mounting pressure on Busra Al Harir as the town stands sandwiched between government forces just days before the attack. [Posts](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/Manqolmain/photos/a.139275016166461/1777805855646694/?type%3D3%26theater&sa=D&ust=1540401260472000) from pro-Syrian government networks on June 24 confirm this showing the strategic importance of the town and indicating an approaching fight to overtake it.

The fight for Busra Al Harir began on June 24 with posts, videos, and images reporting that morning of Syrian government forces and its accompanying militias shelling the town. At 10:01, [Radio Sham FM](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/radioshamfm/posts/1676073642445923&sa=D&ust=1540401260475000) posted alerting of government forces attacking the town. A [video](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid%3D268311490394968%26id%3D221590625067055&sa=D&ust=1540401260476000) posted by a pro-Syrian government page at 09:19 allegedly shows the early shelling of the town. Another [video](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid%3D268311490394968%26id%3D221590625067055&sa=D&ust=1540401260476000) posted by a pro-government accoutn additionally shows the bombing of Busra Al Harir by warplanes. Additionally, a [post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/Syrian.watchers/posts/274286033118467&sa=D&ust=1540401260479000) from the Facebook page SyrianWatchers confirms airstrikes by Russian warplanes on the town. Photos published by [Sham News](https://smartnews-agency.com/ar/photos/2018-06-26-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A7#4) also show the air and ground attack on the town. Moreover, a video circulated by activists on social video and posted at 14:44 [shows a MiG warplane flying low over Busra Al Harir](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/tunza.santhong/posts/1112941155513047&sa=D&ust=1540401260473000). (TAKEN DOWN)

*A still from a video showing an MiG warplane flying low over Busra Al Harir.*

Analyzin shape of the aircraft, wing length, and other distinct aspects, the Syrian Archive was able to identify the warplane as an MiG-23, a plane frequently used in the Syrian conflict.

*An [image](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-23&sa=D&ust=1540401260475000) of a MiG 23, a plane frequently used in the Syrian conflict.*

Given its declining usage by Russian forces and increased usage by the Syrian Airforce, it is likely that the aircraft featured in the video was operated by the Syrian Air Force. The Dutch website [Scramble](https://www.scramble.nl/orbats/syria/airforce) confirms the MiG-23's prevelance in the Syrian Air Force as well as includes information about the plane and air bases/military airports housing the aircraft. The nearest air bases to Busra Al Harir with the MiG-23 are the Khalkhaleh military airport (30 km away) in As-Suwayda's countryside and the Marj Rahil airport (50 km away) just outside Damascus.

On the evening of June 24, after air support from allegedly Russian and Syrian planes, the Syrian army and its accompanying militias began entering Busra Al Harir. [Posts](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/192944268106401/videos/255907208476773/&sa=D&ust=1540401260479000) announcing the army's arrival began appearing at around 19:40. Moreover, soldiers, such as Abdallah Malah, posted at around 19:40 [images](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/abdallah.malah.52/posts/245331846241435&sa=D&ust=1540401260480000) of themselves allegedly on the front lines near the town. 

Shortly after 19:00 and the days after the attack, [soldiers](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2075988246057323&id=100009385034957&__tn__=-R) posted [images](https://www.facebook.com/groups/525959247758164/permalink/656964697990951/) and [videos](https://www.facebook.com/ali.arabi.549668/posts/515124878931110) of themselves in Busra Al Harir with captions describing the weapons left by opposition forces as well as the tactics used by the government to seize the territory. Two days after the raid on June 26 at 15:29, Feras Hasan Al Saoor posted a [video] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/525959247758164/permalink/656964697990951/) of himself in front of Busra Al Harir's police station. In the video, Al Saoor describes the attack as lasting 24 hours and calls the "liberation" a strategic win that opens up Daraa to government forces. [Videos](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2009028722441294) and [images](https://www.facebook.com/damas.times2/photos/a.298038533644340/1721996271248552/?type=3&theater) like Al Saoor's show [soldiers](https://www.facebook.com/supporting.Syrian.military.encyclopedia/posts/1089711401195287) [in and around](https://www.facebook.com/aos.eid.1/posts/2095222387359915?__tn__=-R) the city [the days after the attack](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2065938530401467&id=100009560207508), included in these photos is the [Zulfiqar Brigade]((https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid%3D2139514872985165%26id%3D1825406404396015&sa=D&ust=1540401260480000) an Iraqi military group allegedly [linked to Iran](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.terrorism-info.org.il/en/hezbollah-iran-handled-shiite-militias-integrated-syrian-army-campaign-take-control-south-syria/&sa=D&ust=1540401260481000). Alongside images posted by the soldiers themselves, SANA published a [report](https://web.archive.org/web/20200116040315/https://www.sana.sy/?p=772742) covering the raid.

Amongst the intense fighting by ground and air occurred during this raid, the Syrian Archive identified 3 salient incidents of attacks on vital facilities usually protected by international law. These incidents, alongside their mention reports on by local news sources and the [Syrian Human Rights Committees annual report](https://www.shrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Arabic-report.pdf), reveal the severity of the fight for southern Syria. The incidents include an attack on a health care center in eastern Busra Al Harir, an attack on the town's Civil Defense center, as well as a later attack on a hospital in Al Musayfirah, a town around 20 km south of Busra Al Harir.

### Background on the Facility

Busra Al Harir Health Care Center was established on November 15, 2009 by the Syrian government as a "Family Medical Center," according to an [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20180904070113/http://bosrharir.reefnet.sy/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=414:2009-11-15-15-19-13&catid=2:2009-02-14-07-40-41) from a Busra Al Harir communitiy website sponsored by the Syrian government's Ministry of Local Administration. Providing images, the article shows the medical facility from well before the attack as well as it's location. The Syrian Archive was able to confirm through visual imagery that the center bombed in 2018 was the same as the one established in 2009. This indicates that the Syrian government had some knowledge of medical facility's location during the time of the raid on Busra Al Harir. Although originally a government facility, the facility, according to [Orient News](https://orient-news.net/en/news_show/120513/0/Volunteers-in-Daraa%E2%80%99s-Busra-al-Harir-rehabilitate-Family-Care-Centre) was rehabilitated and is now supported by the [Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM)](https://www.uossm.org/) and, [according to the UOSSM](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/uossm.org/posts/1757864507626270&sa=D&ust=1540401260482000), supports 5,000 patients a month.

*A screenshot of the UOSSM's statement.*

[Nabaa News Agency](https://www.facebook.com/nabaamedia/posts/2224929851062018?__tn__=-R) posted several images of the hospital after the attack reporting it was now out of service. A number of Facebook pages, such as [Houran News](https://www.facebook.com/2187202808178227/photos/a.2187278384837336/2187370148161493/?type=3&theater) posted on June 24 about the attack confirming the facility was pushed out of service by airstrikes. Additionally, Sham News published a [video report](https://smartnews-agency.com/en/videos/2018-06-24-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A7) covering the attacks on Busar Al Harir showing the outside of the facility.

### Geolocating the attacked site
In verifying this attack, the Syrian Archive geolocated the medical facility through additional images and videos revealing the location of the center. An Al Jazeera [video report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DlrD4rY0nCS4&sa=D&ust=1540401260493000) on the town from 2015, for example, shows Busra Al Harir and the surrounding areas. From the photos published of the attack and from the facility's opening in 2009, the Syrian Archive was able to identify landmarks, including a school and mosque neighboring the facility, featured in all the photos and further identify the [location of the attacked medical center](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/uMzSWTgFf112&sa=D&ust=1540401260493000.)

On June 28 2018, activists and news networks, [including Halab Today TV](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/HalabTodayTV/posts/2279677372049688&sa=D&ust=1540401260502000), reported that early in the morning Russian aviation committed a massacre in Al-Musayfirah, a town south of Daraa, that targeted a shelter and killed 25 people.

According to Enab Baladi newspaper, the Civil Defense Center in Daraa reported that [warplanes, on June 28, carried out more than 150 air raids](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/237965&sa=D&ust=1540401260503000) on the towns and villages of the province.

An activist reported that on the morning of June 27, 2018; [both the Civil Defense Center in the Al-Musayfirah town and Sayda town hospital were pushed out of service](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/mahmoud.alshara/posts/10155685241177934&sa=D&ust=1540401260503000) as a result of targeting by the Russian Air Force.
