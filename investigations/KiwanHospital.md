## Introduction
On November 14, 2019 between 21:00 and 21:30, Kiwan Charitable Hospital in Kansafra, a town in the southern Idlib countryside, was hit with two airstrikes from a fixed-wing Russian aircraft pushing the medical facility out of service. Supported by the Syrian Expatriates Medical Association (SEMA), the hospital’s rooms and equipment in the facility’s women and children’s and surgical departments were severely damaged. No casualties or injuries were reported after the attack as staff evacuated the hospital half an hour before the strikes occurred. Utilizing online sources as well as media and information gatehred by the Syrian Archive's investigations team on the ground, the report below examines Al Kiwan Hospital, its vitality to the southern region of the Idlib province, the attack itself, and the damage to the facility. 


## The Background of the Hospital

Kiwan Charitable Hospital is a free medical facility that treats patients in the western part of the Idlib province. The hospital houses a women and children’s wards and has a history of treating residents of the surrounding areas without charge. Kiwan Hospital, according to its medical director Dr. Zahir Qarat, houses incubators, a patient reception ward, clinics, a nutrition department, a cesarean operating room, an ambulance department, a laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology department. 

### Location

Kiwan hospital is located in the [Kansafra village](https://goo.gl/maps/dBBbCV9xiSGKK77C8), which lies in the south western region of the Idlib province around 33 km southwest of Idlib city and 17 km west of Maaret Al Numan. The medical facility is centrally located within the village with the next nearest hospital 7 km area in Kafranbel. 

The location of the hospital was corroborated by matching videos and images from civilian media of the attack and from       media taken by the Syrian Archive’s investigations team with satellite imagery of the location.

*A geolocation of video reports by the investigations team and the [Idlib Health Directorate](https://youtu.be/hY0Ydwh2jPs) of the hospital after the attack matched with satellite imagery taken from Google Earth.* 

### Beneficiaries
The hospital provides services for the [175,000 residents](https://www.sema-sy.org/project/%d9%85%d8%b4%d9%81%d9%89-%d9%83%d9%8a%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%86/) in the surrounding areas and now serves around 980 patients a month. Kiwan, according to its website, works to serve those in Jabal Al Zawiya, parts of Jabal Al Arbaeen, parts of the Maaret Al Numan and Khan Sheikhoun countryside, and the city of Khan Sheikhoun. 

With a women and children's ward, the facility has treated patients free of charge since its establishment with the only exception in 2018. Because of a [discontinuation in financial support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMgkgZnvFK0), the hospital began charging nominal fees but was then later able to provide free services again with the support of SEMA. 

### History of the Hospital
Kiwan Charitable Hospital was originally established in 2000 by Syrian businessman Adnan Kiwan who was living in Ukraine at the time. In an [interview](https://youtu.be/SzeP2wsWClY), Munther Khalil, director of the Idlib Health Directorate, said the hospital since its beginning was charitable rather than private and was known as “Hospital of the Poor.”

In 2011 and 2012 with the beginning of the Syrian revolution and the closing of a significant number of private hospitals, Kiwan hospital in Kansafra played an important role in providing treatment to those in the surrounding areas. Since the hospital stayed open throughout the revolution, especially after the [Massacre of Al Mostumah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPOfSIzyBAw) in Idlib on May 20 2011, people began calling the facility the “Revolution Hospital.” Because of its longstanding status throughout the revolution and the war, the hospital became a symbol of hope for the residents in the area.

*A screenshot of the Syrian government’s [online registry](https://web.archive.org/web/20200405190503/http://www.moh.gov.sy/Default.aspx?tabid=202&language=ar-YE) of government hospitals from 2008, which includes Kiwan Hospital.* 

Having been established in 2000, Kiwan Hospital is [registered online by the Syrian government](https://web.archive.org/web/20200405190503/http://www.moh.gov.sy/Default.aspx?tabid=202&language=ar-YE) as a hospital in the Idlib province from as early as 2008. This indicates and further corroborates that the Syrian government knew of the hospital’s location and directly targeted it. In further corroborating a direct targeting of the facility by Russian or Syrian government forces, the Syrian Government in 2016 classified the hospital and its staff as “wanted.” This classification was based on a [decision](https://babaamr.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AF/) stating: “Adnan Kiwan Charitable Hospital, Maarat Al Numan, Kansafra Village is hiding weapons in the facility with full support of the medical staff. Director of Administration's decision on the Northern Branch Book No. 6846 Date 27/5/2011, assigned Court of Administration with reference number 2053/1 and date 18/6/2011.” This, presumably, was decided to justify attacks on the facility.

### Previous Attacks on the Facility
Although protected from an attack as a medical facility, Kiwan Hospital has been targeted multiple times. The hospital was first attacked 18 September 2012. [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tLg5kl1s2U) show shattered windows, broken hospital beds, and other damage to the interior of the facility . Thereafter, in early 2013, according to a [report](http://sn4hr.org/public_html/wp-content/pdf/arabic/%25D8%25A8%25D8%25AD%25D8%25AB%2520%25D8%25AD%25D9%2588%25D9%2584%2520%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D9%2587%25D8%25AF%25D8%25A7%25D9%2581%2520%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2585%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B4%25D9%2581%25D9%258A%25D8%25A7%25D8%25AA%2520%25D9%2581%25D9%258A%2520%25D8%25B3%25D9%2588%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D8%25A9%2520%25D8%25A8%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2588%25D9%2582%25D8%25A7%25D8%25A6%25D8%25B9%2520%25D9%2588%2520%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25A3%25D8%25B1%25D9%2582%25D8%25A7%25D9%2585.pdf) by the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), regime forces forcefully entered the hospital and killed medical personnel. Later that year on September 1 2013, shortly after the hospital opened its women and children’s ward, the facility was attacked again. Attacks on the facility continued on 15 September 2015 with the [Aleppo Media Center](https://mmc-news.net/%d8%a8%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b1%d9%82%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%ae%d8%b1%d9%88%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%af-%d8%ae%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%84-15-%d9%8a%d9%88/) reporting damage to the hospital from multiple missiles. Later on May 23, 2019, before the November attack on the facility, Kiwan according to [SNHR](http://sn4hr.org/public_html/wp-content/pdf/arabic/Idlib_and_surrounding_areas_have_been_under_indiscriminate_shelling_for_11_weeks_and_the_Security_Council_is_not_moving.pdf) was again damaged from another attack. This incident was additionally [reported on](https://www.acu-sy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/field-Developments-Edition-05-Ar.pdf) by the Assistance Coordination Unit and was followed by the attack of interest on November 24 2019. 


## What Happened (and When)?
![](/assets/investigations/KiwanHospital/image21.jpg)
*An image of the hospital taken after the attack by the investigations team.*

Between 21:00 and 21:30 on Sunday November 24 2019, Kiwan Charitable Hospital was directly targeted and hit by an airstrike that severely damaged the facility’s structure, equipment, and medicine pushing it out of service. There were no casualties from this strike as warnings of a potential attack allowed hospital staff to evacuate the facility before the airstrike. 

Dr. Zahir Qarat, the hospital’s medical director, confirmed in an interview with the Syrian Archive’s Investigations Team that at 21:20 on Sunday November 24th, the hospital was targeted directly by an airstrike that pushed it out of service. 
In his interview, Qarat reported the hospital as in service that day. However, with the village targeted earlier that afternoon between 16:15 and 17:00 and warnings from flight observatories of another potential attack, Qarat initially ordered the evacuation half the staff and patients. At 20:45 with the plane that would eventually target the facility attacking the neighboring village of Kafr Awid, staff completely evacuated the hospital before the attack at 21:20, according to Qarat. 

When discussing the attack, Qarat emphasized and corroborated that the hospital was well in service at the time of the attack. He reported that daily the hospital performs around one hundred examinations of children, admits four babies in incubators, seven into the children’s ward as well as performs an average of three cesarean sections alongside normal deliveries.

Further confirming the time of the attack, Abu Ayman, a staff member of the hospital, said the attack occurred between 21:00 and 21:30 on November 24 in an interview with the Syrian Archive’s investigations team. Ayman claimed that a Russian plane directly targeted the hospital. Arriving moments after the attack occurred, he confirmed that the hospital was destroyed and on fire. Ayman said that most vital departments of the radiology, anesthesia, childbirth, and laboratory equipment were all destroyed. 

Pharmacist Raed Khatib, who works in a private pharmacy near the hospital, confirmed that a Russian plane targeted the hospital on November 24 between 21:00 and 21:30 pushing the facility out of service. Mentioning the preceding attack on Kafr Awid and the subsequent warnings from flight observatories, Khatib also confirmed the evacuation of the hospital around a half hour before the attack. The statements from Khatib, Ayman, and Qarat are corroborated and confirmed by witness media posted online from during and after the attack. 

## Organizations and Local News Reports on the Attack
Reporting both minutes later and days after the attack, human rights organizations, local news sources, and residents detailed that the attack pushed the facility out of service and asserted by the Russian Air Force as responsible.

Alongside Idlib Health Directorate and as mentioned above, Syria TV published a [video report](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2505530133069913) on the attack and [interview](https://youtu.be/SzeP2wsWClY) with Ali Hashoum on Nov 25 and Nov 28. In the longform video report and interview, Hashoum again confirmed the time of the attack as well as mentioned the hospital’s evacuation process given the facility's high risk of attack.

Following reports such as those published by the Syrian Network for Human Rights on November 25, on November 26 at 15:48 the Syrian Civil Defense published a video interview with a member of the Civil Defense team that confirmed the time of the strike as at 21:20 on November 24. The team member confirmed that this time of attack matches reports by the Civil Defense of a Russian aircraft above the villages at 21:15. According to the Civil Defense team member, an explosion was heard before the location of attack was determined as Kiwan Hospital. The video discusses the evacuation of the hospital patients and staff as well as the extensive destruction to the hospital from the attack. Alongside the Civil Defense, the Syrian Expatriates Medical Association posted a video on its Facebook page at 16:34 on November 26  confirming the airstrike on Kiwan hospital as well as emphasizing the targeting as “direct.”
