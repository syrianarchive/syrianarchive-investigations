## Introduction
On November 14, 2019 between 21:00 and 21:30, Kiwan Charitable Hospital in Kansafra, a town in the southern Idlib countryside, was hit with two airstrikes from a fixed-wing Russian aircraft pushing the medical facility out of service. Supported by the Syrian Expatriates Medical Association (SEMA), the hospital’s rooms and equipment in the facility’s women and children’s and surgical departments were severely damaged. No casualties or injuries were reported after the attack as staff evacuated the hospital half an hour before the strikes occurred. The investigation below examines Al Kiwan Hospital, its vitality to the southern region of the Idlib province, the attack itself, and the damage to the facility.

Kiwan Hospital, according to its medical director Dr. Zahir Qarat, houses incubators, a patient reception ward, clinics, a nutrition department, a cesarean operating room, an ambulance department, a laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology department.

Kiwan hospital is located in the [Kansafra village](https://goo.gl/maps/dBBbCV9xiSGKK77C8), which lies in the south western region of the Idlib province around 33 km southwest of Idlib city and 17 km west of Maaret Al Numan. The medical facility is centrally located within the village with the next nearest hospital 7 km area in Kafranbel. 

The location of the hospital was corroborated by matching videos and images from civilian media of the attack and from       media taken by the Syrian Archive’s investigations team with satellite imagery of the location.

### Beneficiaries
The hospital provides services for the [175,000 residents](https://www.sema-sy.org/project/%d9%85%d8%b4%d9%81%d9%89-%d9%83%d9%8a%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%86/) in the surrounding areas and now serves around 980 patients a month. Kiwan, according to its website, works to serve those in Jabal Al Zawiya, parts of Jabal Al Arbaeen, parts of the Maaret Al Numan and Khan Sheikhoun countryside, and the city of Khan Sheikhoun. 

With a women and children's ward, the facility has treated patients free of charge since its establishment with the only exception in 2018. Because of a [discontinuation in financial support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMgkgZnvFK0), the hospital began charging nominal fees but was then later able to provide free services again with the support of SEMA. 

### History of the Hospital
Kiwan Charitable Hospital was originally established in 2000 by Syrian businessman Adnan Kiwan who was living in Ukraine at the time. In an [interview](https://youtu.be/SzeP2wsWClY), Munther Khalil, director of the Idlib Health Directorate, said the hospital since its beginning was charitable rather than private and was known as “Hospital of the Poor.”

In 2011 and 2012 with the beginning of the Syrian revolution and the closing of a significant number of private hospitals, Kiwan hospital in Kansafra played an important role in providing treatment to those in the surrounding areas. Since the hospital stayed open throughout the revolution, especially after the [Massacre of Al Mostumah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPOfSIzyBAw) in Idlib on May 20 2011, people began calling the facility the “Revolution Hospital.” Because of its longstanding status throughout the revolution and the war, the hospital became a symbol of hope for the residents in the area.

Having been established in 2000, Kiwan Hospital is [registered online by the Syrian government](https://web.archive.org/web/20200405190503/http://www.moh.gov.sy/Default.aspx?tabid=202&language=ar-YE) as a hospital in the Idlib province from as early as 2008. This indicates and further corroborates that the Syrian government knew of the hospital’s location and directly targeted it. In further corroborating a direct targeting of the facility by Russian or Syrian government forces, the Syrian Government in 2016 classified the hospital and its staff as “wanted.” This classification was based on a [decision](https://babaamr.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AF/) stating: “Adnan Kiwan Charitable Hospital, Maarat Al Numan, Kansafra Village is hiding weapons in the facility with full support of the medical staff. Director of Administration's decision on the Northern Branch Book No. 6846 Date 27/5/2011, assigned Court of Administration with reference number 2053/1 and date 18/6/2011.” This, presumably, was decided to justify attacks on the facility.

### Previous Attacks on the Facility
Although protected from an attack as a medical facility, Kiwan Hospital has been targeted multiple times. The hospital was first attacked 18 September 2012. [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tLg5kl1s2U) show shattered windows, broken hospital beds, and other damage to the interior of the facility . Thereafter, in early 2013, according to a [report](http://sn4hr.org/public_html/wp-content/pdf/arabic/%25D8%25A8%25D8%25AD%25D8%25AB%2520%25D8%25AD%25D9%2588%25D9%2584%2520%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D9%2587%25D8%25AF%25D8%25A7%25D9%2581%2520%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2585%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B4%25D9%2581%25D9%258A%25D8%25A7%25D8%25AA%2520%25D9%2581%25D9%258A%2520%25D8%25B3%25D9%2588%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D8%25A9%2520%25D8%25A8%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2588%25D9%2582%25D8%25A7%25D8%25A6%25D8%25B9%2520%25D9%2588%2520%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25A3%25D8%25B1%25D9%2582%25D8%25A7%25D9%2585.pdf) by the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), regime forces forcefully entered the hospital and killed medical personnel. Later that year on September 1 2013, shortly after the hospital opened its women and children’s ward, the facility was attacked again. Attacks on the facility continued on 15 September 2015 with the [Aleppo Media Center](https://mmc-news.net/%d8%a8%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b1%d9%82%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%ae%d8%b1%d9%88%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%af-%d8%ae%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%84-15-%d9%8a%d9%88/) reporting damage to the hospital from multiple missiles. Later on May 23, 2019, before the November attack on the facility, Kiwan according to [SNHR](http://sn4hr.org/public_html/wp-content/pdf/arabic/Idlib_and_surrounding_areas_have_been_under_indiscriminate_shelling_for_11_weeks_and_the_Security_Council_is_not_moving.pdf) was again damaged from another attack. This incident was additionally [reported on](https://www.acu-sy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/field-Developments-Edition-05-Ar.pdf) by the Assistance Coordination Unit and was followed by the attack of interest on November 24 2019.
