## Introduction
On November 14, 2019 between 21:00 and 21:30, Kiwan Charitable Hospital in Kansafra, a town in the southern Idlib countryside, was hit with two airstrikes from a fixed-wing Russian aircraft forcing the medical facility out of service. Supported by the Syrian Expatriates Medical Association (SEMA), the hospital’s rooms and equipment in the facility’s women and children’s and surgical departments were severely damaged. No casualties or injuries were reported after the attack as staff evacuated the hospital half an hour before the strikes occurred. Utilizing online sources as well as media and information gathered by the Syrian Archive's investigations team on the ground, the report below examines Al Kiwan Hospital, its vitality to the southern region of the Idlib province, the attack itself, and the resulting damage to the facility. 


## The Background of the Hospital

*An [image](http://sn4hr.org/%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%86%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%A9-7-8-2015/) from 2015 of Kiwan Hospital published by the Syrian Network for Human Rights.*

Kiwan Charitable Hospital is a free medical facility that treats patients in the western part of the Idlib province. The hospital houses women and children’s wards and has a history of treating residents in the surrounding areas free of charge. Kiwan Hospital, according to its medical director Dr. Zahir Qarat, houses incubators, a patient reception ward, clinics, a nutrition department, a cesarean operating room, an ambulance department, as well as a laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology department. 

### Location

*An image taken from Google Earth of Kansafra and its neighboring villages.*
  
Kiwan hospital is located in the [Kansafra village](https://goo.gl/maps/dBBbCV9xiSGKK77C8), which lies in the southwestern region of the Idlib province around 33 km southwest of Idlib city and 17 km west of Maaret Al Numan. The medical facility is centrally located in the village with the next nearest hospital 7 km area in Kafranbel. 

The location of the hospital was corroborated by matching videos and images from online civilian media of the attack and from media taken by the Syrian Archive’s investigations team with satellite imagery of the location.

*A geolocation of video reports by the investigations team and the [Idlib Health Directorate](https://youtu.be/hY0Ydwh2jPs) of the hospital after the attack matched with satellite imagery taken from Google Earth.* 

### Beneficiaries
Prior to the attack, the hospital provided services for the [175,000 residents](https://www.sema-sy.org/project/%d9%85%d8%b4%d9%81%d9%89-%d9%83%d9%8a%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%86/) in the surrounding areas treating around 980 patients a month. Kiwan, according to its [website](https://www.sema-sy.org/project/%d9%85%d8%b4%d9%81%d9%89-%d9%83%d9%8a%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%86/), worked to serve those in Jabal Al Zawiya, parts of Jabal Al Arbaeen, parts of the Maaret Al Numan and Khan Sheikhoun countryside, and the city of Khan Sheikhoun. 

The facility treated patients free of charge since its establishment with an exception in 2018 as a [discontinuation in financial support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMgkgZnvFK0) forced the hospital to begin charging nominal fees. However, later that year, Kiwan was able to return to its original mission and provide free services again with the support of SEMA. 

### History of the Hospital
Kiwan Charitable Hospital was originally established in 2000 by Syrian businessman Adnan Kiwan who was living in Ukraine at the time. In an [interview](https://youtu.be/SzeP2wsWClY), Munther Khalil, director of the Idlib Health Directorate, said the hospital since its beginning was charitable rather than private and was known as “Hospital of the Poor.”

In 2011 and 2012 with the beginning of the Syrian revolution and the closing of a significant number of private hospitals, Kiwan hospital in Kansafra played an important role in providing treatment to those in the surrounding areas. Since the hospital stayed open throughout the revolution, especially after the devestating [Massacre of Al Mostumah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPOfSIzyBAw) in Idlib on May 20 2011, people began calling the facility the “Revolution Hospital.” Because of its longstanding status throughout the revolution and war, the hospital became a symbol of hope for the residents in the area.

*A screenshot of the Syrian government’s [online registry](https://web.archive.org/web/20200405190503/http://www.moh.gov.sy/Default.aspx?tabid=202&language=ar-YE) of government hospitals from 2008, which includes Kiwan Hospital.* 

Having been established in 2000, Kiwan Hospital was [registered online by the Syrian government](https://web.archive.org/web/20200405190503/http://www.moh.gov.sy/Default.aspx?tabid=202&language=ar-YE) as a hospital in the Idlib province beginning as early as 2008. This indicates and further corroborates that the Syrian government knew of the hospital’s location at the time of the attack. Moreover, in 2016, the Syrian Government classified the hospital and its staff as “wanted." This classification was based on a [decision](https://babaamr.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AF/) stating: “Adnan Kiwan Charitable Hospital, Maarat Al Numan, Kansafra Village is hiding weapons in the facility with full support of the medical staff. Director of Administration's decision on the Northern Branch Book No. 6846 Date 27/5/2011, assigned Court of Administration with reference number 2053/1 and date 18/6/2011.” This, presumably, was decided to justify attacks on the facility and increases the likelihood that Russian or Syrian government forces are responsible for the attack.

### Previous Attacks on the Facility
Although protected from an attack as a medical facility, Kiwan Hospital has been targeted multiple times. The hospital was first attacked on September 18, 2012. [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tLg5kl1s2U) show shattered windows, broken hospital beds, and other damage to the interior of the facility . Thereafter, in early 2013, according to a [report](http://sn4hr.org/public_html/wp-content/pdf/arabic/%25D8%25A8%25D8%25AD%25D8%25AB%2520%25D8%25AD%25D9%2588%25D9%2584%2520%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D9%2587%25D8%25AF%25D8%25A7%25D9%2581%2520%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2585%25D8%25B3%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B4%25D9%2581%25D9%258A%25D8%25A7%25D8%25AA%2520%25D9%2581%25D9%258A%2520%25D8%25B3%25D9%2588%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D8%25A9%2520%25D8%25A8%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2588%25D9%2582%25D8%25A7%25D8%25A6%25D8%25B9%2520%25D9%2588%2520%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25A3%25D8%25B1%25D9%2582%25D8%25A7%25D9%2585.pdf) by the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), regime forces forcefully entered the hospital and killed medical personnel. Later that year on September 1, 2013, shortly after the hospital opened its women and children’s ward, the facility was attacked again. Attacks on the facility continued on September 15, 2015 with the [Aleppo Media Center](https://mmc-news.net/%d8%a8%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b1%d9%82%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%ae%d8%b1%d9%88%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d9%88%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%af-%d8%ae%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%84-15-%d9%8a%d9%88/) reporting damage to the hospital from multiple missiles. Later on May 23, 2019, before the November attack on the facility, Kiwan according to [SNHR](http://sn4hr.org/public_html/wp-content/pdf/arabic/Idlib_and_surrounding_areas_have_been_under_indiscriminate_shelling_for_11_weeks_and_the_Security_Council_is_not_moving.pdf) was again damaged from another attack. This incident was additionally [reported on](https://www.acu-sy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/field-Developments-Edition-05-Ar.pdf) by the Assistance Coordination Unit and was followed by the latest attack on November 24, 2019. 


## What Happened (and When)?
![](/assets/investigations/KiwanHospital/image21.jpg)
*An image of the hospital taken after the attack by the investigations team.*

Between 21:00 and 21:30 on Sunday November 24, 2019, Kiwan Charitable Hospital was directly targeted and hit by an airstrike that severely damaged the facility’s structure, equipment, and medicine pushing it out of service. There were no casualties from this strike as warnings of a potential attack permitted hospital staff to evacuate the facility before the airstrike. 

Dr. Zahir Qarat, the hospital’s medical director, confirmed in an interview with the Syrian Archive’s investigations team that at 21:20 on Sunday November 24th, the hospital was targeted directly by an airstrike that pushed it out of service. 
In the interview, Qarat reported the hospital as in service that day. However, with the village targeted earlier that afternoon between 16:15 and 17:00 and warnings from flight observatories of another potential attack, Qarat ordered the evacuation of half the staff and patients. According to Qarat, at 20:45 with the plane that would eventually target the facility attacking the neighboring village of Kafr Awid, staff completely evacuated the hospital before the attack at 21:20. 

Qarat emphasized and corroborated that the hospital was well in service at the time of the attack. He reported that daily the hospital performs around one hundred examinations of children, three cesarean sections (alongside normal deliveries) as well as admits four babies in incubators and seven into the children’s ward.

Further confirming the time of the attack, Abu Ayman, a staff member of the hospital, said the airstrike occurred between 21:00 and 21:30 on November 24 in an interview with the investigations team. Ayman claimed that a Russian plane directly targeted the hospital. Arriving moments after the attack occurred, he confirmed that the hospital was destroyed and on fire. Ayman also said that the most vital equipment in the radiology, anesthesia, childbirth, and laboratory departments were all destroyed. 

Pharmacist Raed Khatib, who works in a private pharmacy near the hospital, confirmed that a Russian plane targeted the facility on November 24 between 21:00 and 21:30 pushing the facility out of service. Mentioning the preceding attack on Kafr Awid and the subsequent warnings from flight observatories, Khatib also confirmed the evacuation of the hospital around a half hour before the attack. The statements from Khatib, Ayman, and Qarat are corroborated and confirmed by verified witness media posted online from during and after the attack. 

## Organizations and Local News Reports on the Attack
Reporting both minutes later and days after the attack, human rights organizations, local news sources, and residents detailed that the airstrike pushed the facility out of service asserrting the Russian Air Force as responsible for the devestation.

In its post, Idlib Gate also claims the attack was committed by Russian forces.

Alongside a [statement](https://www.facebook.com/Idleb.Health.Directorate/posts/2084077081695636?__tn__=-R) published on its Facebook page at 10:49 on November 25, the Idlib Health Directorate posted a [video](https://youtu.be/hY0Ydwh2jPs) showing the damage to the hospital from the attack as well as an interview with Ali Hashoum, the director of Kiwan Hospital. In his interview, Hashoum says the attack came from a Russian plane and emphasized that it pushed the facility out of service. Similar damage is seen in video reports done by [Anadolu News Agency](https://www.facebook.com/blyooooon/videos/972045403174556/?v=972045403174556) and [Enab Baladi](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=551126145434510), which were both posted in the afternoon and evening a day after the attack on November 25.

Alongside Idlib Health Directorate and as mentioned above, Syria TV published a [video report](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2505530133069913) on the attack and [interview](https://youtu.be/SzeP2wsWClY) with Ali Hashoum on Nov 25 and Nov 28. In the longform video report and interview, Hashoum again confirmed the time of the attack as well as mentioned the hospital’s evacuation process given the facility's high risk of attack.

Following [reports](http://sn4hr.org/sites/news/2019/11/25/russian-forces-bombed-hospital-kansafra-village-idlib-suburbs-november-24/) such as those published by SNHR, on November 26 at 15:48 the Syrian Civil Defense published a [video interview](https://youtu.be/o085x5QxTH0) with a member of the local Civil Defense team that confirmed the time of the strike as on November 24 at 21:20. The team member reported that the time of 21:20 matches reports by the Civil Defense of a Russian aircraft above the village at 21:15. He discusses the evacuation of the hospital patients and staff as well as the extensive destruction to the hospital from the attack. According to the team member, an explosion was heard before the location of the strike was determined as Kiwan Hospital. Alongside the Civil Defense, SEMA posted a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=3022809924609786) on its Facebook page at 16:34 on November 26 confirming the airstrike on Kiwan hospital as well as emphasizing the targeting as “direct.” 

These reports were followed by an [article](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/flashnews/2019/12/13/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%B2%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B9-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B6%D8%AE%D9%85) published by Al Araby that detailed the attack and the damage to the facility. As reviewed below, the damage to Kiwan hospital, both from the impact of the attack itself and later fires, was irreparable and forced the facility out of service.

The damage to Kiwan Hospital from the attack was determined and analyzed by the Syrian Archive through open source media as well as interviews, videos, and pictures taken by the investigations team on the ground. The media taken by the  team, alongside the open source media found online, corroborate and confirm statements that the hospital was directly targeted and pushed out of service. 

### External Damage

As shown in the videos and images taken by the investigations team, the hospital suffered severe damage externally with the hospital’s structure almost fully collapsed. Although part of the hospital’s main building was left still standing, the left block of Kiwan Hospital, which includes the medical warehouse and examination rooms, was completely destroyed with the roof collapsed and rooms exposed. Images and footage reveal that the concrete columns of the hospital’s main building were broken and no longer able to support the hospital’s structure.

An additional building to the right of the primary hospital building, which is the hospital’s ambulance entrance, also suffered significant external damage with its windows broken and rooms’ walls destroyed. The hospital’s pharmacy faced severe damage with the entirety of the pharmacy burned and one of its walls destroyed. The hospital’s severe external damage matches its devastating internal damage, which rendered the hospital out of service.

### Internal Damage

When first entering the hospital, large boulders from the hospital's structure scattered on the hospital floor reveal the severe extent of the damage from the attack on the facility’s interior. The reception and waiting rooms on the first floor are covered in concrete and splintered wood debris from the hospital’s walls, ceiling, and furniture.

The hospital’s ambulance room, on the basement or bottom floor, was additionally damaged with the remnants of the ceiling, the ceiling fan, as well as medical equipment covering the ground. Moreover, the hospital’s laboratory in the basement was left covered in debris after the attack with necessary equipment destroyed from the missile's impact. With the facility's roof collaposed, access to the second floor was blocked by rubble preventing access to other parts of the facility. Up the stairs on the second floor, debris from broken windows, hospital equipment, and burnt medicine from the pharmacy block the hospital corridors.

Additional rooms on the hospital's on the second floor were damaged including the doctor’s clinic and office. The nutrition department’s windows were destroyed from the attack with glass on the department’s floor and furniture. The women’s drug store suffered severe damage with the majority of its equipment and medicine ruined. The women’s restroom suffered equal damage with pieces of furniture and the ceiling covering the ground. The hospital’s administration room was in a similar condition with cracks in the wall, files strewn around the room, and its door ripped off the wall. Moreover, the X-Ray room’s door was broken with the X-ray equipment damaged. The pharmacy's interior, like its exterior, was completely destroyed and burned with the medicine and equipment inside the pharmacy lost.

This destruction of Kiwan hospital has left residents in the countryside of Idlib with increasingly less options for medical help. The extensive damage to the hospital corroborates its direct targeting, a prevalent feature of the Russian-Syrian military campaign. 


## Flight Data and Analysis
To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross referenced findings from open source media and images/videos taken by the investigations team with flight observation data from a spotter organization. Data for flights occurring before and after 21:00 - 21:30 on November 24, 2019 around Idlib and Hama was closely analyzed.

First in Latakia at Hmemim Airbase, a Russian fixed wing aircraft was seen taking off in the southeastern direction at around 20:35. At 20:52, a Russian fixed wing aircraft was then seen flying east near the village of Bara, which lies only around 6 km away from the hospital. Shortly thereafter at around 20:55, a Russian fixed wing aircraft was spotted circling over the Maarat Hurma, a village 13 km south of Kansafra. Lastly, and shortly before the airstrike, at 21:01 a Russian fixed wing aircraft is observed circling over Jabal Shahshabo, an area 18 km south of Kansafra. Although not circling over Kansafra itself, this common practice of circling by warzone aircrafts indicates target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack. Furthermore, the circling by a fixed wing Russian aircraft over the neighbouring villages of Kansafra corroborates the estimated time of the attack of between 21:00 and 21:30 as mentioned in interviews conducted by the investigations team and in local news reports. 

Although this data matches claims by human rights organizations, local news sources, and interviewed witnesses that the attack was committed by the Russian Air Force, there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircraft was involved in the attack on Kiwan Hospital. Nevertheless, the presence of aircrafts above the neighboring villages and towns increases the likelihood that an air attack occurred on the hospital during the time detailed in interviews with the investigations team and by local news sources online. 

## Conclusion
On November 24 2019, Kiwan hospital, supported by the Syrian Expatriates Medical Association, was attacked and pushed out of service. Providing free treatment to residents in the area, the hospital’s various departments including its women and children’s wards were destroyed. The time of the attack and the damage to the hospital was confirmed through open source media found online, media and interviews captured by the investigations team at the attack site, and flight observation data. Although witnesses, local news sources, and flight observation data points towards the Russian Air Force as responsible for the attack, the Syrian Archive is unable to fully confirm the perpetrators of the attack given the limitations of the investigation. This attack, like many other, is illegal and severely limits the ability for Syrians to access healthcare in a deadly warzone.
