Thereafter, Hisham Al Abdullah, a correspondent for Orient Television in the countryside of Idlib, [published a video report](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DpDtU38PE_oM&sa=D&ust=1538477135301000) on what he described as two air raids on Harem. According to Al Abdullah, the first airstrike destroyed a number of the town's residential buildings, and the second airstrike targeted and damage the main market in the city. In a report, a Civil Defense member further confirms the attack stating that "the city of Harem was subjected to several air raids believed to be Russian in the market area near the Grand Mosque." Reporting prelimary death tolls, a doctor in Harem who spoke with Al Abdullah confirmed that around 30 civlians were killed from the attack with the hospital having admitted an additional 50 civlians for serious injuries.

The [Idlib Syrian Civil Defense's](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/SyrianCivilDefenceIdlibWhiteHelmets/photos/a.479509938814734/1609876025778114/?type%3D3&sa=D&ust=1538477135301000) provincial Facebook page [published an infographic](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://archive.fo/JKrGB&sa=D&ust=1538477135302000) on the Harem city attacks. In this image, as a preliminary assessment of the two airstrikes, the Civil Defense reports the death toll reached 31 people killed, in addition to the 50 seriously injured .

That same day, [Kafar Yahmoul coordination committee](https://www.facebook.com/k.nn.hos/) published the [names of those civilians  killed](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://archive.fo/y9AiW&sa=D&ust=1538477135303000) as a result of this attack.

The following day (23 March), Orient Television published another video which [increased the number of casualties from the attack from 31 to 42](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DreWiAxofGVY&sa=D&ust=1538477135303000). According to the correspondent, the first raid hit the popular market in the old garage area near the vegetable market, destroying more than 100 shops. Witnesses stated that the market was crowded with civilians, and the location of the raid is far from any military headquarters.

The video claimed that the second raid attacked a civilian residential area, including a kindergarten. Because the strike hit outside of attendance hours (several witnesses stated the two airstrikes occurred after the late-afternoon call to prayer), the kindergarten was mostly empty as it was hit outside of attendance hours.

[The first airstrike](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/maps/place/36%25C2%25B012'33.5%2522N%2B36%25C2%25B031'12.0%2522E/@36.2092191,36.519996,179m/data%3D!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d36.2093028!4d36.5199889&sa=D&ust=1538477135316000) targeted the popular market near the Great Mosque and near the vegetable market. [The second airstrike](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/maps/place/36%25C2%25B012'36.4%2522N%2B36%25C2%25B031'11.2%2522E/@36.210025,36.5197782,261m/data%3D!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d36.210121!4d36.519764&sa=D&ust=1538477135316000) targeted a residential complex inhabited by civilians, according to witnesses.
