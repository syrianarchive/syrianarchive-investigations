## Introduction

On March 22, 2018, Harem was hit by two missiles around 16:00, which damaged the town's street market as well as a nearby residential complex. Destroying the market and collapsing a residential building, the attack killed at least 31 civilians and injured over 50 others.   

### Methodology
Syrian Archive conducted an investigation into the incident, based on:

(1) Securing, analysing, and verifying of 31 videos and images uploaded to social media networks purportedly showing the incident as well as examining flight observation data;
(2) Analysing satellite imagery as well as flight observation data; 
(3) The combined analysis of these sources culminating in the present report. Complementing each other, they provide information regarding the attack’s date and time, location, and extent of damage.

Examining all information available on the attack, the investigations team developed an understanding of the incident and potential perpetrators.

## Background
![](/assets/investigations/Harem/image50.jpg)
*Satellite imagery from Google Earth showing the location of [Harem](https://goo.gl/maps/xjm7jbEvVNmCvKtSA) in northeastern Idlib near the Turkish border.*

Harem is a city approximately 2.3 km away from the Turkish border in northern Idlib. Given its proximity to Turkey, the city houses thousands of displaced people, according to the [Qatar Red Crescent](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/assessments/idps_from_eastern_syria.pdf). Additionally, despite its location well within the established [De-Escalation Zones signed in 2017](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5cF-gIL8yzk&sa=D&ust=1538477135299000), Harem has faced several attacks, such as in [September](https://www.facebook.com/khaled.kanjo.908/posts/506505986370455) [2017](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1071016533035862), from Russian and Syrian Air Forces. Just before the March 2018 attack on Harem, the villages of [Hass](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DvhWCokTU6GA&sa=D&ust=1538477135316000) (March 20, 2018) and [Kafr al-Battikh](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dbf1-afwsPv0&sa=D&ust=1538477135316000) (March 21, 2018) in the Idlib Governorate were attacked as well killing dozens of civilians, mostly women and children. 

## What Happened? 

After collecting and analysing images and videos published on social media platforms and news networks, Syrian Archive concluded that on March 22, 2018 at roughly 16:00 the town of Harem was hit by two missiles on the popular market and a nearby residential building. The strikes severely damaged the market burning stores and surrounding buildings as well as collapsed a residential building with civlians inside. This attack killed over 31 people and injured over 50 others.

[The first missile](https://goo.gl/maps/H1jsA15932ZnXcLCA) hit the popular market near the Grand Mosque and the neighboring vegetable market.

*The location of the two airstrikes in the popular market area in western Harem, according to witnesses and visual analysis. The distance between both attack sites is 90 meters.*

Further confirming that Harem was hit with two strikes, a [video](https://www.facebook.com/1765254933690858/videos/2064178657131816/?v=2064178657131816) posted onto Facebook and taken on the outskirts of Harem shows the an airstrike on the city. An airstirke is also shown in a [video](https://www.facebook.com/khaled.alaseer.33/videos/307222189801937) posted by Facebook user Khaled Al Aseer taken from above the town. This video shows the surrounding area as well as the sun. Estimating the time from the position of the sun in the video, one of the strikes hit Harem most likely at around 15:30-16:30.

![](/assets/investigations/Harem/Image4343.png)
*The sun's position in a [video](https://www.facebook.com/khaled.alaseer.33/videos/307222189801937) from Facebook user Khaled Al Aseer confirms the time of the attack as between 15:30-16:30. Syrian Archive used the tool [SunCalc](https://www.suncalc.org/#/36.2059,36.524,15/2018.03.22/16:00/1/1) to estimate the position of the sun around the alleged time of the attack.* 

These estimated times match reports from the Syrian Civil Defense in Idlib on the attack. Reporting on the two airstrikes on Harem, a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4SJoYgo7hU) from the Civil Defense shows the rescue operations at both impact sites as well as an interview with a local Civil Defense team member. According to the member, and further corroborating the estimated time of attack, the two strikes on March 22 took place at around 16:00 after the call to Salat Al Asr (the late-afternoon prayer) which, in the Idlib governorate, was [recited at 15:08](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://timesprayer.today/1677-month03-year2018-%25D8%25AC%25D8%25AF%25D9%2588%25D9%2584-%25D9%2585%25D9%2588%25D8%25A7%25D9%2582%25D9%258A%25D8%25AA-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25B5%25D9%2584%25D8%25A7%25D8%25A9-%25D8%25B4%25D9%2587%25D8%25B1-%25D9%2585%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1%25D8%25B3-%25D8%25A5%25D8%25AF%25D9%2584%25D8%25A8.html&sa=D&ust=1538477135305000). Given the extreme damage from the attack, the rescue efforts according to the local Civil Defense team member took over 17 hours.

Hisham Al Abdullah, a correspondent with Orient News, published a [video report](https://youtu.be/pDtU38PE_oM) hours after the attack covering the raids. Alongside showing the damage, Al Abduallah confirmed that two airstrikes hit the town severely damaging the market and residential areas. A doctor who spoke with Al Abduallah in the report confirmed that alongside severe damage to the city around 30 civlians were killed from the attack and 50 were admitted to the town's hospital suffering from serious injuries.

In the video, a witness confirms that, pointing to the location of the second strike, the building hit was a residential complex inhabiated by families. With parts of the building still standing, the video shows a side of the complex completely collapsed from the blast.

*A still from a video posted by Orient News showing the effort to recover those stuck under the rubble of the collapsed building hit in the second strike.*

The efforts to recover those injured and killed in the attack were widely documented. Videos from [Nedaa Syria Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg4SInsCizA) and [Baladi News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBzihKgrKqo) amongst others show the intense efforts by the Civil Defense to rescue those injured by the strikes. Moreover, journalist, Ayman Abu Al Shouq published a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LT1lFxzalU) on YouTube showing victims of the attack in the hospital. 

Initial [posts](https://www.facebook.com/SyrianCivilDefenceIdlibWhiteHelmets/photos/a.479509938814734/1609876025778114/?type=3&theater) from the Civil Defense report over 31 killed and 50 injured in the strikes. The following day after the attack, [Orient News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reWiAxofGVY) published another video reporting an increase in the number of civlians killed from 31 to 42. Noting that the location of the market is far from any military headquarters, witnesses in the video reports described the market as crowded with residents at the time of the attack. Alongside covering the damage as well as the number killed and injured, [Al Araby](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/politics/2018/3/22/%D9%85%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-30-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%A5%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A8) and [Enab Baladi](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/215460) purport the Russian Air Force as responsible for the attack.
