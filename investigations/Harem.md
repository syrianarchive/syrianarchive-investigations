ï»¿Harem is one of the largest border cities with Turkey *and is one of the joint control areas between the Tahrir al-Sham organization and opposition forces according to the [map of control and influence](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.omrandirasat.org//assets/investigations/Harem/M.C.A.P/%25D8%25AE%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D8%25B7%25D8%25A9%2520%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2586%25D9%2581%25D9%2588%25D8%25B0%2520%25D9%2588%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25B3%25D9%258A%25D8%25B7%25D8%25B1%25D8%25A9%2520%25D9%2581%25D9%258A%2520%25D8%25B3%25D9%2588%25D8%25B1%25D9%258A%25D8%25A9%2520%25D9%2588%25D8%25BA%25D8%25B1%25D8%25A8%2520%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25B9%25D8%25B1%25D8%25A7%25D9%2582%2520-%252015%2520%25D9%2586%25D9%258A%25D8%25B3%25D8%25A7%25D9%2586.pdf&sa=D&ust=1538477135309000) provided by the Omran Center for Strategic Studies.* Moreover, according to the [Qatar Red Crescent](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/assessments/idps_from_eastern_syria.pdf&sa=D&ust=1538477135298000), the city contains many housing shelters which house thousands of displaced persons.

## What Happened? 

**INCLUDE SATELLITE IMAGERY**

After collecting and analysing images and videos published on social media platforms and news networks, Syrian Archive concluded that on 22 March 2018 at roughly 16:00 the town of Harem was targeted with two airstrikes on the popular market and the surrounding area in western Harem. Russian forces are likely responsible for the attack. The airstrikes on Harem are the third attack in Idlib by Russian aircraft in three days. The attack occurred days after airraids on [Hass](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DvhWCokTU6GA&sa=D&ust=1538477135316000) (March 20, 2018) and [Kafr al-Battikh](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dbf1-afwsPv0&sa=D&ust=1538477135316000) (March 21, 2018), which resulted in the death of dozens of civilians, mostly women and children.

Reporting on the two airstrikes on Harem, the vieo shows the rescue operations at both impact sites as well as an interview with a local Civil Defense team member. According to the member, the two strikes on March 22 took place at around 16:00 shortly after the call to Salat Al Asr (the late-afternoon prayer) which, in the Idlib governorate, was [recited at 15:08](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://timesprayer.today/1677-month03-year2018-%25D8%25AC%25D8%25AF%25D9%2588%25D9%2584-%25D9%2585%25D9%2588%25D8%25A7%25D9%2582%25D9%258A%25D8%25AA-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25B5%25D9%2584%25D8%25A7%25D8%25A9-%25D8%25B4%25D9%2587%25D8%25B1-%25D9%2585%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1%25D8%25B3-%25D8%25A5%25D8%25AF%25D9%2584%25D8%25A8.html&sa=D&ust=1538477135305000). Given the extreme damage from the attack, the rescue efforts according to the local Civil Defense team member took over 17 hours.
