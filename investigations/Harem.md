*Satellite imagery from Google Earth showing the location of [Harem](https://goo.gl/maps/xjm7jbEvVNmCvKtSA) in northeastern Idlib near the Turkish border.*

Harem is a large city, under opposition control at the time of the attack, in the Idlib province. The city is approximately 2.3 km away from the Turkish border. Given its proximity to Turkey, the city houses thousands of dispalced people according to the [Qatar Red Crescent](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/assessments/idps_from_eastern_syria.pdf).Additionally, despite its location well within the established [De-Escalation Zones signed in 2017](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5cF-gIL8yzk&sa=D&ust=1538477135299000), Harem has faced several attacks from Russian and Syrian Air Forces.
