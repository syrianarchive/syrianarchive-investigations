Captured and published by international media, the picture of the [injured one-year-old](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/posts/577950433017929) after the attack was used and asserted as evidence to the targeting of civilians in Idlib. 

Although Abdul Mohsen survived, his brothers, Bilal and Hassan, were killed by the airstrike. Abdul Mohsen’s sister Aya was injured and transferred to Turkey for treatment. His father Mohammed Al Deeb and grandfather Abdo Al Hammadi were amongst the nine civilians killed by the attack on the market in the village of Balyoun.

### Methodology

Syrian Archive conducted an investigation into the incident, based on three steps:

(1) A local investigation’s team collected testimonies from eye-witnesses or those who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the airstrike;
(2) Securing, analysing, and verifying of 47 videos and images uploaded to social media networks purportedly showing the incident;
(3) The combined analysis of these sources has culminated in the present investigation report. Complementing each other, they provide information regarding the attack’s date and time, location, casualties, and extent of damage. 

Examining all information available on the attack, the investigations’ team developed an understanding of the incident and potential perpetrators.

## Background on Balyoun:

*[Images](https://www.facebook.com/blyooooon/photos/a.2024479801125259/2660989014140998/?type=3&theater) of Balyoun before and after the attack posted by Blyon Voice.*

The population of the small village of [Balyoun](https://goo.gl/maps/e7ZQbNkTBQZNKMLi6)(35.699651, 36.504135), which is located in Jabal Al Zawiya in southern Idlib province, has increased in the past few years. Having not been directly targeted since 2017, the “semi-safe” town, according to those the Syrian Archive’s investigations team spoke with in Balyoun, is a haven for many of the families from neighboring villages and towns. As a home for the displaced, Balyoun’s population has now reached about thirty thousand people. 

The town is located amongst a circle or area of villages around Jabal Al Zawiya (including Kansfara, Al Bara, Ehsim, and Ablin) that have been directly targeted throughout the past year. These villages are now almost completely empty of their residents because of attacks, while Balyoun has seen an increase in the number of homes as well as additional multistory apartment buildings to accommodate new residents.

Now in Balyoun, migrants from other villages have positively impacted its economy. This is best seen in its street or clothing market which, according to long-time residents of Balyoun, has significantly grown in recent years. In northeast Balyoun, the market, which at first did not exceed more than ten stores, now extends more than a kilometer and includes at least a hundred shops selling clothes, food, furniture, and electric appliances. The market also houses three pharmacies. 

As the center of life for Balyoun and the target of the recent airstrikes on the village, the market, according to shop owners, hosts hundreds of visitors every hour. The only reason, according to villagers, more weren’t killed in the attack was an initial airstrike on an agricultural road 300 meters away from the market. After this strike, residents of the village feared the market would be next and began evacuating, nevertheless civilians were still killed and injured by the blasts.

Posts evaluating the damage from directly after the attack were followed by videos and images posted hours after the attack showing the efforts to rescue and recover those injured and killed. Journalist and media activist Hadi Al Abdullah, for example, uploaded a [video](https://youtu.be/UTXZBbrZPm8) at 18:08 showing rescue efforts by the local Civil Defense teams to rescue civilians trapped under the market’s rubble. Additional videos uploaded by the [Idlib Health Directorate](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2082525618516791) and the [Idlib Civil Defense](https://www.facebook.com/SyrianCivilDefenceIdlibWhiteHelmets/videos/444858409558086/) itself show ambulances arriving at the scene of the attack as well as first responders rescuing and sending those injured to nearby hospitals. Moreover, at 17:44, around three hours after the attack, the Civil Defense released an [initial assessment](https://www.facebook.com/SyrianCivilDefenceIdlibWhiteHelmets/posts/2568182669947440?__tn__=-R) of nine killed and fourteen injured from the attack.

Following an analysis of the civilian media featured above, the Syrian Archive investigation team confirmed the impact site as well as the market buildings damaged as a result of the airstrike. With the attack taking place at the [street market](https://goo.gl/maps/5evwEAoSWK435DAw5)in northeast Balyoun, the investigations team identified 5 distinct buildings that were severely damaged from the attack. The destruction of the small but populated village of Balyoun was extensive and devastating. It also proves testing for those who moved to the village seeking safety.

When documenting those dead and injured from the attack, the Syrian Archive’s investigations team corroborated the number and identity of those injured and killed by meeting with villagers and reviewing open source media. The team confirmed that nine were killed from the attack and fourteen were injured.  

The nine killed were four members of the Al Hammadi family ([Abdo Al Hammadi](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/578569136289392/?type=3&theater), [Mohammad Deeb Abdo Al Hammadi](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577631163049856/?type=3&theater), [Bilal Mohammed Deeb Al Hammadi](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577652379714401/?type=3&theater), and [Hassan Mohammed Deeb Al Hammadi](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577669053046067/?type=3&theater)) from Balyoun, [Ahmed Al Nabhan](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577651049714534/?type=3&theater), [Majid Mohammad Hassan Al Abod](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577649956381310/?type=3&theater) from Balyoun, Umm Omar originally from Homs but owns a shoe store in Balyoun’s market, Jamil Bakour from Maratah, and [Zaid Khalid Abu Al Khish](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=156712485645145&id=100039191828599) from Al Fatira. 


## Flight Data Analysis
To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross referenced findings from open source media and images/videos taken by the investigations team with flight observation data from a spotter organization. Data for flights occurring briefly before, during, and briefly after the time of the attack (14:00 - 14:15) on December 7, 2019 around Idlib was closely analyzed.  

<iframe height="550" src="https://public.tableau.com/profile/syrianarchiveorg#!/vizhome/FlightObservationson7December2019/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=y" width="780"></iframe>

Around twenty minutes before the attack on Balyoun, at approximately 13:40, spotters first observed a fixed wing Russian aircraft departing southeast from Hmeimim Airbase. Shortly thereafter, at 13:54, a Russian fixed wing aircraft was spotted circling Jabal Al Zawiya, an area surrounding Balyoun village. Previous research has found that warplanes circling over a location indicates target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack. Furthermore, at 14:09, a Russian fixed wing aircraft was spotted flying north over Kafr Oweid, a village just southwest of Balyoun. Lastly, presumably after the airstrike on the village (around 14:05, 14:11, and 14:27), Russian fixed wing aircraft were spotted flying south over Kafranbel, a village 10 km south of Balyoun.  

Although this data matches media and posts on social media that purport the attack as committed by the Russian Air Force, no evidence available shows the direct involvement of the observed aircraft in the attack on Balyoun. Nevertheless, the presence of these aircrafts above the neighboring villages and towns at the time that the attack occurred increases the likelihood that the airstrike was carried out by the Russian Air Force.


# Conclusion
As detailed in interviews conducted by the investigations team, verified open source media, and flight observation data, Balyoun market and its surrounding residential areas were attacked by an airstrike with two missiles on 7 Dec 2019 between 14:00 and 14:15. The missiles, according to testimony, hit the house of the Al Hammadi family near the market and a school around thirty meters away. The attack killed nine people and injured fourteen others. Because of the limited information available in open source investigations, the Syrian Archive was unable to definitively identify the perpetrators of the attack. However, flight observation data, witness testimony, and open source media indicate the Russian Air Force as potentially responsible for the attack.
