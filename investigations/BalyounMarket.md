Abdul Mohsen Al Hammadi did not know what happened. Suddenly, on a Saturday afternoon on December 7 2019, he found himself in an ambulance carrying him to the nearest medical point for treatment. Captured and published by international media, [the picture of the one-year-old crying from his injury](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/posts/577950433017929) was used and asserted as evidence to the targeting of civilians in Idlib.

Although Abdul Mohsen survived, his brothers, Bilal and Hassan, were killed by the airstrike. Abdul Mohsen’s sister Aya was injured and transferred to Turkey for treatment. His father Mohammed Al Deeb and grandfather Abdo Al Hammadi were amongst the other nine killed alongside the fourteen injured from the attack on the clothing market in the village of Balyoun. As the home of the Al Hammadi family, Balyoun village lies in Idlib’s southern countryside and was perceived as a somewhat safe part of Idlib.

## Background on Balyoun:

*[Images](https://www.facebook.com/blyooooon/photos/a.2024479801125259/2660989014140998/?type=3&theater) of Balyoun before and after the attack posted by Blyon Voice.*

The population of the small village of Balyoun, which is located in Jabal Al Zawiya in southern Idlib province, has increased in the past few years. Having not been directly targeted since 2017, the “semi-safe” town, according to those met in Balyoun by the Syrian Archive’s investigations team, is a haven for many of the families from neighboring villages and towns. As a home for the displaced, Balyoun’s population has reached about thirty thousand people. The town is located amongst a circle or area of villages around Jabal Al Zawiya (including Kansfara, Al Bara, Ehsim, and Ablin) that have been directly targeted throughout the past year. These villages are now almost completely empty of their residents because of attacks, while Balyoun has seen an increase in the number of homes as well as additional multistory apartment buildings to accommodate new residents.

Now in Balyoun, migrants from other villages have significantly improved its economy. This is best seen in its street or clothing market which, according to long time residents of Balyoun, has significantly grown in recent years. In northeast Balyoun, the market, which at first did not exceed more than ten stores, now extends more than a kilometer and includes at least a hundred shops selling clothes, food, furniture, and electric appliances. The market also features three pharmacies.

As the center of life for Balyoun and the target of the airstrikes on the village, the market, according to shop owners, hosts hundreds of visitors every hour. The only reason, according to villagers, more weren’t killed in the attack was an initial airstrike on an agricultural road 300 meters away from the market. After this strike, residents of the village feared the market would be next and began evacuating, however civilians were still killed and injured in the blasts.

## What Happened (and When)?

A street market in Balyoun Village was targeted and hit between 14:00 and 14:15 on Saturday December 7 2019 killing ten people and wounding thirteen others. According to witness testimony as well as images and videos uploaded to social media, two airstrikes hit the village. One targeted and struck the house of Abdul Mohsen Hamadi killing five members of his family. The other missile hit near the village’s high school, which is about 30 meters away from Al Hammadi’s home.

When documenting those dead and injured from the attack, the Syrian Archive’s investigations team corroborated the number and identity of those injured and dead by meeting with villagers and reviewing open source media. The team confirmed that 10 were killed from the attack and thirteen were injured.

The nine killed were 5 members of the Al Hammadi family ([Abdo Al Hammadi](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/578569136289392/?type=3&theater), [Mohammad Al Deeb Abdo Al Hammadi](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577631163049856/?type=3&theater), [Bilal Mohammed Al Deeb Al Hammadi](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577652379714401/?type=3&theater), [Hassan Mohammed Al Deeb Al Hammadi](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577669053046067/?type=3&theater), Aya Al Hammadi) from Balyoun, [Ahmed Omar Al Nabhan](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577651049714534/?type=3&theater), [Majid Mohammad Hassan Al Abod](https://www.facebook.com/bluoninmemory.blogspot/photos/a.212025756277067/577649956381310/?type=3&theater) from Balyoun, Umm Omar originally from Homs but owns a shoe store in Balyoun’s market, Jamil Bakour from Maratah, and [Zaid Abu Al Khish](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=156712485645145&id=100039191828599) from Al Fatira.

In previous posts by the Civil Defense, [images and videos](https://www.facebook.com/SyrianCivilDefenceIdlibWhiteHelmets/posts/2568182669947440?__tn__=-R) show extreme damage to the market and surrounding areas. The roofs of a number of buildings collapsed after the attack with water tanks broken on the ground, iron sunshades crumpled and made shrapnel, and shops themselves uprooted and destroyed. The burnt contents of shops and rubble from the surrounding buildings cover the floor of the market and its surrounding streets. [Images](https://www.facebook.com/blyooooon/photos/a.2024479801125259/2662465023993397/?type=3&theater) and [videos](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=739079143227411) posted by Blyon voice show similar damage of collapsed buildings covered in blood and downed electricity poles.

*A still from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0TSxgoumWc&feature=youtu.be) uploaded by Baladi News showing the removal of rubble from the town’s streets.*

[Media](https://www.facebook.com/blyooooon/posts/2662037170702849?__tn__=-R) published by the AFP shows the destruction of buildings surrounding the market including six houses. Moreover, a [video](https://youtu.be/D0TSxgoumWc) uploaded by Baladi News Network shows the removal of the stones, cement ceilings, and iron covering the streets and market. The destruction of the small but populated village of Balyoun from the attack was extensive and devastating as well as proves testing for those who moved to the village seeking safety.

## Flight Data Analysis:

To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross referenced findings from open source media and images/videos taken by the investigations team with flight observation data from a spotter organization. Data for flights occurring before and after 14:00 - 14:15 on December 7, 2019 around Idlib was closely analyzed.

<iframe height="550" src="https://public.tableau.com/profile/syrianarchiveorg#!/vizhome/FlightObservationson7December2019/Sheet1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=y" width="780"></iframe>

At around 13:40, spotters first observed a fixed wing Russian aircraft departing southeast from Hmeimim Airbase around twenty minutes before the attack on Balyoun. Shortly thereafter at 13:54, a Russian fixed wing aircraft was spotted circling Jabal Al Zawiya, an area surrounding the village. Previous research has found that warplanes circling over a location indicates target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack. Furthermore, at 14:09, a Russian fixed wing aircraft was spotted flying north over Kafr Oweid, a village just southwest of Balyoun. Lastly, at times presumably after the airstrikes (around 14:05, 14:10, and 14:25), Russian fixed wing aircraft were spotted flying south over Kafranbel, a village 10 km south of Balyoun.

Although this data matches interviews with villagers by the investigations team as well as media and posts on social media that purport the attack as committed by the Russian Air Force, there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircraft was involved in the attack on Balyoun. Nevertheless, the presence of aircrafts above the neighboring villages and towns increases the likelihood that an air attack occurred on the market during the times shown and corroborated by open source media and reported on by the Syrian Archive’s investigations team.

## Conclusion:

As detailed in interviews conducted by the investigations team, verified open source media, and flight observation data, Balyoun market and its surrounding areas were attacked with an airstrike of two missiles on 7 Dec 2019 between 14:00 and 14:15. The missiles hit the house of the Al Hammadi family near the market and a school around thirty meters away. The attack killed ten people and injured over thirteen others. Because of the limitations of open source investigations, the Syrian Archive was unable to fully confirm the perpetrator of the attack although flight observation data, witness testimony, and open source media claims the airstrike was committed by the Russian Air Force.
