### Hospital Location:

Serving a diverse but remote population, Al Iman in the western countryside of Aleppo in the village of Urem Al Kubra. Surrounded mostly by agricultural land, the hospital is far from any military targets with its surroundings quite empty for over 2 kilometers. This indicates its deliberate targeting.

### Previous Attacks on the Facility

Before the attack of interest in August 2019, the facility suffered from attacks in August 2016 and June 2019. On August 14th 2016, the hospital was first attacked with the facility suffering from severe damage. As shown in [images](https://www.facebook.com/aliemanhospital/posts/320582551614677?__xts__[0]=68.ARCb_e7klHUMybRhZ7VDbMixfvQa4M3Jsdz2tt1K5njP548AxNtK1edc36pV_RZarmJP_eEnWlYjAnKbyk1SNY6Uy2DWjMzWA2dlyRza3Zd1efbhTbJKkfFxjxpBifs2ChvqxZ6faq5TkndMSWw3wwuDbt5NLdMy3yC3iPeB7y_uZPaiLj0XpAOlIt76YDXAbM9XQSFehAsnp4jskqfrEc0xAU0Q5mqNcZfiMkx4i859_WUG-pPjvOg2Q_CWhL8FWkbaLCnwaVoUdcIj1rIhR_SmnD7ke_t1Iy6tyTnxMW0rnhOzcRVYu7OeQ0pFAouZX4edVPmFP2F38oPXgjQt1f0&__tn__=H-R) posted by the [hospital’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/aliemanhospital/), the attack was a direct hit on the hospital with a deep crater in the hospital’s courtyard and in front of the hospital building itself. Alongside images, the hospital posted a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=321747398164859) about the facility featuring damage from the attack. The video claims it was Russia who committed the attack. The hospital closed after this attack and reopened in 2017.

Al Iman Hospital experienced another attack on June 28th 2019. Human Appeal [reported](https://www.humanappeal.org.uk/news/press-releases/2019/human-appeal-strongly-condemns-aleppo-hospital-attack/) an attack on the facility by tanks which forced the hospital out of service requiring its pativideoents to be transferred to neighboring medical facilities. No citizen media was found showing this attack. Nevertheless, these previous attacks on Al Iman hospital as well as the attack in August 2019 indicate and corroborate a direct and deliberate targeting of the facility.

## What Happened and When?

Confirmed by interviews conducted by the investigations team as well as online open source media, Al Iman hospital was directly targeted by six high explosive rockets that hit the hospital’s main courtyard and generators cutting it off from its necessary infrastructures like oxygen and electricity. Because of this attack, the hospital was forced out of service. Hospital doctors and staff, the Syrian Civil Defense, and local news sources, confirmed the targeting of hospital, which is located within the [de-escalation zones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cF-gIL8yzk) and lands under the [ceasefire agreement said to be implemented at 6 AM Saturday, August 31st 2019](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/russia-announces-ceasefire-syria-idlib-saturday-190830090649837.html). Al Iman hospital was directly and deliberately targeted by fixed-wing aircrafts just five hours before this agreement took effect.

A map of the [Deescalation Zones](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/syria-de-escalation-zones-explained-170506050208636.html) agreed to by Russia, Turkey, and Iran in May 2017.

Occurring at around 1 - 1:30 AM, the attack resulted in six injured including three children in incubators, two medical staff, and a woman accompanying her child. The hospital staff and others who were injured were immediately transferred to nearby hospitals by the Syrian Civil Defense. Fearing other airstrikes, those in the hospital fled into the agricultural land surrounding the hospital. The hospital, as discussed in the next section of this investigation, was severely damaged internally and externally with two cars for medical staff and the hospital generator destroyed from the attack.

This satellite imagery further confirms the day the medical facility was attacked as well as its extensive damage.

### Witness Reports and Testimonies:

In an interview with the investigations team, Dr. Mustafa Barakat, medical director for Human Appeal, confirmed that an attack on Al Iman hospital occurred at 1 AM which caused serious damage to the hospital completely pushing it out of commission. Dr. Barakat, in congruence with images and videos taken after the attack, described the hospitals infrastructure (of generators and ambulances) as completely destroyed with windows and incubators broken and the operating room out of service. According to the director, the strikes on the hospital lasted for around half an hour. Shortly after the first missile hit the hospital, patients and medical personnel evacuated to the basement.

Ismail Barakat, one of the staff in the hospital during the attack, reported to the investigations team that around 100 patients and visitors were in the hospital at 1:00 AM. They were evacuated to the basement quickly after the first strike which, according to Ismail Barakat, occurred between 1:00 - 1:15 AM. Omar Al Sharif, another hospital staff member who witnessed the attack, confirmed that the facility was attacked beginning at 1 AM with six missiles.

Hussein Badawi, director of Center 104 for the Civil Defense in the western countryside of Aleppo, confirmed that the hospital was targeted by high explosive missiles which destroyed the necessary infrastructure for the hospital to function. Badawi reported that the Civil Defense evacuated around 35 people from the hospital. He also reported that warplanes targeted the civil defense team with two missiles during their arrival at the scene (video on drive apparently).

In an [interview](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?t=55&v=688723991539698), Al Iman Hospital doctor Mustafa Hablous confirmed that the attack took place on August 31, 2019. He also confirmed that in the hospital there were around 30 children in and outside of incubators and that the children’s ward suffered significantly from the first strike. The doctor described the attack as “tragic” and said that the children lived those minutes of the attack amid horror and fear.

### Organizations and Local News Reports: 

A large number of local news sources reported on the attack further confirming its time as well as its extent of damage on the hospital. The Syrian Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets, published [photos](https://www.facebook.com/SCDaleppo/posts/2441293149283662?__xts__[0]=68.ARDa6QpK6IuUlFwRlI5VS1iGolus44wc-hMrNiiZlJZMyOrQAEDPd0d4nDq2TP0ZiJ-kEVqj2-ARw5O4jOjaI_M_jjSHPScAAOrGylZ3rO7mMws9Hh-nEkMzPnz7-9qlqJkr-tLRhnOtc3epk66y4dUbICzhW0ZbJzfZ1nzrTN-IccBAKUCBvscjP9ADdUezm-IexXVekFxQqkVMeKACNzVY4ViBJMqsnDOhxaEP8001D3c53nauTCM6NQZDeSlWKAitp1nyfCywvqAtWuf6KZHR1t1yIs_c4xQFB7P7xPq6-8wYWkXD3zDZpFisJOlwLq9LpHMwQCRSBII6hAMPJl-sRg&__tn__=-R) on their Facebook page at 2:31 AM, an hour after the attack, of the damage done to the hospital from the airstrike and its victims.

In an interview with the investigations team, Omar Jamal Ibrahim, a Civil Defense Center volunteer dispatched to the hospital, confirmed that the Civil Defense Teams were attacked two times while evacuating patients and sending those injured to nearby hospitals. The double tap attacks occurred during the first evacuation of the injured and medical personnel to neighboring hospitals and second when evacuating others.

In regards to local media, at 12:30 AM the Urem Al Kubra Media Center [published](https://www.facebook.com/357524471390415/photos/a.665771027232423/665770520565807/?type=3&theater) an alert on its Facebook page of an attack on the village further confirming the early morning time of the attack. Nine hours after the attack at 10:25 AM, activist Feras Mwalla posted [photos](https://www.facebook.com/firasmawlla2/photos/pcb.3224108987606837/3224108647606871/?type=3&theater) showing the damage to the hospital from the airstrike. The local news source Halab Today posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdBwWwXT7o&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR2jhEZu7JOmceRjfj89HgSfI1jN6TpknCWNv8c1SqZE4NILmlTnyyn6MKU) on youtube at 10:25 AM reporting on the attack. Additionally at 11:25 AM, the Free Aleppo Health Directorate posted a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1556862237843056) of the damage to the hospital from the attack.

Beginning in the afternoon of the day of the attack and the days following the incident, organizations both in and outside of Syria reported on the hospital attack with some claiming it was committed by Russian forces. The Syrian Human Rights Commission published a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?t=49&v=388120871897089) of the damage from the airstrikes at 1:55 PM. This was followed by images and videos from the [Aleppo Media Center](https://www.facebook.com/AleppoAMC/photos/pcb.876749706036066/876749382702765/?type=3&theater) and the [Syrian Press Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AxR4ZCiwng&fbclid=IwAR2GK9VmayB4rmOl6s-7kLiHTWv87M3TKGMX2gkQmSE5u49nwsZHvGtl1-g) of the damage from the attack as well as interviews with hospital personnel. Claiming the attack was committed by the Russians, the Syrian Network for Human Rights later released a [statement](http://sn4hr.org/sites/news/2019/08/31/russian-forces-bombed-hospital-urm-al-kubra-village-aleppo-august-31/) confirming the attack saying the hospital was targeted by an airstrike from fixed wing warplanes. Lastly, Human appeal released a [statement](https://www.humanappeal.org.uk/news/press-releases/2019/human-appeal-strongly-condemns-second-aleppo-hospital-attack/) on its website of the attack detailing the serious damage done to the hospital and the injuries suffered by victims of the attack.

## Analysis of the Damage:

A still of Al Iman hospital from above after the attack shown in a [video report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKY15ae3HeE) uploaded onto YouTube by the Syrian Civil Defense.

The internal and external damage suffered by the hospital from the attack rendered the facility’s rooms and infrastructure unusable pushing it fully out of service.

### External Damage

The airstrike most dramatically affected the outside of the hospital crippling its necessary infrastructures as shown in the photos taken by the investigations team below. With the airstrike landing 3 meters away from the hospital’s primary building, the hospital’s main paved courtyard, which stood towards the front of the hospital, was completely destroyed with its distinctive roundabout now nonexistent. Alongside the front courtyard and entrance itself, two cars belonging to the hospital were flipped and destroyed.

![](/assets/investigations/alimanhospital/image5.png)![](/assets/investigations/alimanhospital/image6.jpg)

On the sides of the hospital, generators for electricity and oxygen were irreparable after the attack.

The facility is left standing only because the airstrike hit the soil which absorbed some of the shock of the explosions. Nevertheless, the windows, doors, and rooms of the hospitals were left smashed and shattered after the attack.

### Internal Damage: 

Internally, as shown in the images from the investigations team, a large number of machinery and departments were damaged as a result of the attack. As described in interviews, images show a damaged incubator room confirming reports of two of the ten incubators as out of service with others significantly damaged.

## Flight Data and Analysis:

To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross referenced findings from the open source media above and the media from the investigations team with flight observation data from a spotter organization. Data for flights occurring before and after 1:00 - 1:30 AM around Idlib, Aleppo, Lattakia, and, more specifically, Urem Al Kubra was closely analyzed.

[https://public.tableau.com/views/ObservationsofFlightDatafromAugust30-312019/Sheet1?:display\_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz\_share_link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://public.tableau.com/views/ObservationsofFlightDatafromAugust30-312019/Sheet1?:display_count%3Dy%26publish%3Dyes%26:origin%3Dviz_share_link&sa=D&ust=1574093566390000)

At 12:31 AM a Russian Fixed Wing Aircraft was observed taking off from Hmemim Airbase in Lattakia around 122 Kilometers southwest of Urem Al Kubra. At 12:55 AM, a Russian Fixed Wing Aircraft is then observed circling over the neighboring towns of Al Zerbeh and Khantuman, which both lie around 10 Kilometers south of Urem Al Kubra. At 12:56 AM, a Russian fixed wing aircraft is observed circling over Urem Al Kubra shortly before reports of the airstrike hitting the hospital after 1 AM. With the common practice of circling by warzone aircrafts indicating a target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack, the circling by a Fixed Wing Russian Aircraft over Urem Al Kubra corroborates the estimated time of the attack as reported by local news organizations and in interviews conducted by the Syrian Archive’s investigations team

Although this data matches claims by human rights organizations that the attack was committed by the Russian Air Force, there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircraft was involved in the attack on Urem Al Kubra. Nevertheless, the presence of aircrafts above the village and its neighboring towns increases the likelihood that an air attack occurred on the hospital during the times shown and corroborated by open source media and reported on by the Syrian Archive’s investigations team.

## Conclusion:

Through documentation and interviews conducted by the Syrian Archive’s investigations team, an analysis of online open source media, and flight observation data, the Syrian Archive is able to confirm that Al Iman Hospital in Urem Al Kubra was attacked at around 1:00 - 1:30 AM on August 31st 2019. The attack forced the facility, supported by Human Appeal, out of service and resulted in six people injured. Given the limitations of the investigation, the Syrian Archive is unable to confirm the perpetrators of the attack although statements by witnesses attribute the attack to the Russian Air Force.
