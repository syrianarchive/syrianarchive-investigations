# What happened?

Verified open source media affirms that Dar Al-Hikma Hospital was targeted on 28 May 2019. Shelling and airstrikes caused debilitating damage to the building, forcing the hospital out of service. The hospital is located in the [de-escalation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/syria-de-escalation-zones-explained-170506050208636.html) and ceasefire zone, as was recently [upheld publicly by Russian and Syrian forces](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/russia-announces-unilateral-ceasefire-syrian-forces-idlib-190519182039997.html). Nonetheless, reports suggest that the private hospital was intentionally targeted as part of a larger Syria-Russia offensive that has been increasing in intensity [since the 30 April 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Syria_offensive_(April_2019%E2%80%93present). This attack resulted in 3 people  injured as [reported](https://smartnews-agency.com/ar/album/383074/%25D8%25AF%25D9%2585%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1-%25D9%2585%25D8%25B4%25D9%2581%25D9%2589-%25D8%25AF%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25AD%25D9%2583%25D9%2585%25D8%25A9-%25D9%2581%25D9%258A-%25D9%2583%25D9%2581%25D8%25B1%25D9%2586%25D8%25A8%25D9%2584-%25D9%2586%25D8%25AA%25D9%258A%25D8%25AC%25D8%25A9-%25D9%2582%25D8%25B5%25D9%2581-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2586%25D8%25B8%25D8%25A7%25D9%2585%23134721&sa=D&ust=1563107522392000) by SMART news agency, internal and external damage to the building of the hospital, damage to two cars and two electric generator as well as medical equipment according to an interview done with the manager of the hospital Dr Ahmad Al Aqraa.

The cardiologist Dr. Ahmad Al Aqraa is the manager and owner of Dar Al Hikma Hospital, which he confirmed was built in Kafr Nabl in 1997 and operating in 2000. The private hospital, according to Al Aqraa, is officially licensed by the Syrian government.

> The cardiologist emphasized that Dar Al Hikma hospital was targeted multiple times previously because "we are doing our job in the hospital treating civilians."

The Idlib Health Directorate, additionally corroborating Dr. Al Aqraa, published a [statement](http://ihd-sy.org/2019/05/28/%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83/) on the attack claiming the hospital was directly targeted by the regime as well as reporting the hospital as destroyed.

*Images of the hospital after the attack included in the Idlib Health Directorate’s Press Statement*

According to a local news report released the morning of the attack, Dar Al-Hikma was attacked as a part of several air raids on Kfar Nabl and greater Idlib. Photos and videos showing the damage to the building were uploaded by [citizens,](https://twitter.com/dr_hammady/status/1133309630187220992)  [reporters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZWZTfuG9pY) and [news agencies,](https://smartnews-agency.com/ar/album/383074/%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%83%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%AC%D8%A9-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85#134721) including [Orient News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYTImxFEg8E), who were on the ground soon after the attack.

Multiple sources confirm Dar al-Hikma as a well-known hospital in Kafr Nabl and Southern Idlib. Local [blog posts](https://syriastories.net/en/resources-overstretched-in-kfar-nabel-hospitals/) as well as activists from early 2015 mention the hospital, and the increasing direness of its operations since attacks on local hospitals have intensified. An [article](https://syriastories.net/%25D9%2585%25D8%25B4%25D8%25A7%25D9%2581%25D9%258A-%25D9%2583%25D9%2581%25D8%25B1%25D9%2586%25D8%25A8%25D9%2584-%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B9%25D9%2585%25D9%2584-%25D8%25A8%25D8%25B7%25D8%25A7%25D9%2582%25D8%25AA%25D9%2587%25D8%25A7-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2582%25D8%25B5%25D9%2588%25D9%2589/) by Syriastories.net from 2015 emphasized the role of the hospital in treating victims of the bombardments in Idlib’s countryside and references the facility as working at “maximum capacity.”

Officially, it is listed as a hospital that is part of the official Syrian Ministry of Health, pictured below.

![](/assets/investigations/daralhikma/image18.png)

Government website lists hospital in directory.

Although it is difficult to confirm the exact date the hospital opened, its name is listed on the public website of the countryside knowledge network that was set up by the Ministry of Local Administration as [early as 2007 as shown](https://web.archive.org/web/20071201012750/http://www.reefnet.gov.sy/ImpInfo/Telephones/health.htm) using the WayBackMachine website. Moreover, an [article](http://esyria.sy/sites/code/index.php?site=idleb&p=stories&category=face&filename=2008060511350431) was published in 2008 profiling the now head of the hospital Dr. Ahmed al-Aqraa mentioning that he started working there since 1996.

![](/assets/investigations/daralhikma/image4.png)

The [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/daralhekmahAkdaa/) of Dar Al-Hikma Hospital was created in 2013. Photos of the hospital were published on the facebook page such as the ones shown below.

![](/assets/investigations/daralhikma/image14.png)

The Syrian Archive investigation team made an interview with Dr Majed Aqraa who was in the hospital when it was attacked on May 28 2019. He mentioned:
At 09:30 an airstrike targeted a village called [Maar Tamater](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%B1) and [Jbala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jbala,_Idlib). An injured came to our hospital from Jbala to be treated and it seems that he was being monitored by a drone. After 15 minutes as we are treating the injured person the hospital was targeted with an airstrike. Then at 09:45 the hospital was targeted with aircraft cannon and shelling from rocket launcher at the same time.  

Several posts and videos were published online about an airstrike targeting the village of Maar Tamater on May 28 2019. Below are the some of those posts that can be used to corroborate the testimony of Dr Majed.

Idlib PLUS news agency [published the following facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/IDLIBPLUS/posts/2237411389809444) mentioning that Maar Tamater is being targeted with airstrikes. The post was published at 09:33 am Damascus time. This corroborates what Dr Majed mentioned about someone being injured as a result of an airstrike on Maar Tamater and Jbala.

The facebook page of Maar Tamater Now [published a video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=368247123801706) at 10:37 am Damascus time mentioning that Maar Tamater was targeted with airstrikes from helicopter. This resulted of one family being under rubble.

Fajer press facebook page [published a post on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2151335805158513&id=1465923513699749) on May 29th mentioning that Kafr Nabel and its surrouding villages such as Maar Tamater were attacked with shelling and airstrikes which resulted in the killing of a women and its child. The facebook page of Maar Tamater Now [published a video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2484050414961530) mentioning the name of the women (Aisha Adeeb Othman) and child (Khaled Ahmad Yousef).

Dr Majed also mentioned that the airstrike and shelling that targeted the hospital starting at 09:45 were almost at the same time with 3 to 6 minutes between them. He also said that the shelling came from the direction of [Braideej](https://goo.gl/maps/BB3G13qf3m357Jgx6) village which is under the Syrian government control area.

![](/assets/investigations/daralhikma/liveumap-may-2019.png)

Photos and videos were published online mentioning that the city of kafrnabel was targeted with airstrikes and shelling at the same time. The posts also mentioned that the shelling is coming from the direction of [Braideej](https://goo.gl/maps/BB3G13qf3m357Jgx6) village.

Ahmad Al Hameed Al Bayoush [published on his facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/bayoushahmad/posts/1016177768585899) that KafrNabel was targeted with three airstrikes as well as shelling from Baideej at the same time. The sound of shelling can be heard on the following [video](https://www.facebook.com/bayoushahmad/videos/1016182358585440/) that was published at 10:01 am Damascus time.

Another [video published](https://www.facebook.com/haseeb.deeb.7/videos/318319722401122/) on facebook by Haseeb Deeb shows smokes as a result of airstrikes as well as shelling that is coming from Braideej checkpoint.

The Syrian Archive investigation team found and located tanks in Braideej as shown below:

An artillery base was also found be located in Salba as shown below:

![](/assets/investigations/daralhikma/salba.png)

The Syrian Archive is unable to confirm the exact type of those vehicles because of the low resolution of the satellite imagery.

# Where did this happen and when?

Dar al-Hikma Hospital is located in the village of Kafr Nabl south of Idlib. It’s location can be confirmed using open source satellite imagery and corroborating media as featured below.

These images and videos confirm local reports of the hospital as pushed out of service because of this most recent attack.

# Flight Data Analysis

To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross referenced findings from the media above with flight observation data from a spotter organization. Data for flights around 10:40 near Kafranbel in the Idlib province were more closely analyzed. From the data, the Syrian Archive is able to more confidently confirm the time of the attack. Above the town Kafranabel itself, a Yak 130 (Mitten) was reported as circling the town at around 10:16 preceding an SU-22 (Fitter) which was spotted circling the town at around 10:48. Circling by aircrafts in war zones is common as previous research has found that circling flights typically indicate target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack.

Moreover in the towns of Saraqib and Teftnaz, which neighbor Kafranabel to the north, an SU-24 (Fencer) was spotted flying south from both towns at 10:31 and 10:40. From south of Kafranbel, a SU-24 (Fencer) was identified as flying north at around 10:40. These flight position additionally match reports of Su-22 (Fitter) and SU-24 (Fencer) flying north and north west from Shayrat and T-4 West Airbases in Homs at 10:20-23. The direction and times of these flights corroborates the above investigation of an attack around 10:40 in Kafranbel.

[View full visualisation](https://public.tableau.com/views/Observations104028May2019Kafranbel/Sheet1)

Given that there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircraft was involved in the attack on Kafranbel the presence of these aircrafts above the town as well as neighboring towns increases the likelihood that an air attack occurred at this location during the times shown and reported on by citizen reporters as well as humanitarian groups, and as estimated using imagery from the attack.

However, no casualties were reported.

# De-escalation zone

On May 4 2017, the sponsoring states of Astana Talks (Russia, Turkey and Iran) [signed a memorandum of understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5cF-gIL8yzk) for the establishment of de-escalation zones in Syria which took effect on May 6 2017. The Russian Ministry of Defence [published a map showing](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Atarib-Market-Bombing.html) the locations included in this memorandum as shown below (de-escalation zones in blue, ISIS in grey, Syrian army in orange). Kafr Nabl town is located within the de-escalation zone.

![](/assets/investigations/daralhikma/image6.jpg)

A month of heavy shelling has ransacked the Idlib governorate, creating a "[humanitarian disaster](https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sc13826.doc.htm)" in the officially demilitarized zone.

Dar Al-Hikma was one of the last remaining hospitals in the area, after two hospitals were firebombed in Kafr Nabl in one month alone. This includes the Orient hospital, which has [sustained multiple attacks](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/kafrnabel.html) since 2017. The attacks were so intense that the Idlib health directorate released a statement on the 6th of May pushing operations to an emergency status.

![](/assets/investigations/daralhikma/image11.jpg)

# Repeated Attacks targeting Dar Al Hikma Hospital

In an interview with the Syrian Archive, Dr Ahmad Al Aqraa (manager and owner of Dar Al Hikma Hospital) mentioned that the hospital was attacked multiple times previously between 2012 and 2014 after the Syrian government [withdrew control of Kafr Nabl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bxBkDEdK1w) in August 2012. The Syrian Archive investigation team did not find visual documentation to confirm these previous attacks.

# Conclusion

Based on both the open source documentation and flight data featured above, it is confirmed that Dar al-Hikma Hospital was attacked on 28 May 2019 between 09:45 and 10:40 am Damascus time. From this attack, the hospital, which is licensed by the Syrian government and had a history of providing services in the locality since 2000, was destroyed externally and internally rendering it out of service. However, given the limitations of open source data, the Syrian Archive is unable to confirm the perpetrators of the attack although local sources claim it was attacked with shelling and airstrikes by the Russian or Syrian Air Force.
