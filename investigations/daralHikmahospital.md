# What happened?

Verified open source media affirms that Dar Al-Hikma Hospital was targeted on 28 May 2019. Airstrikes caused debilitating damage to the building, forcing the hospital out of service. The hospital is located in the [de-escalation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/syria-de-escalation-zones-explained-170506050208636.html) and ceasefire zone, as was recently [upheld publicly by Russian and Syrian forces](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/russia-announces-unilateral-ceasefire-syrian-forces-idlib-190519182039997.html). Nonetheless, reports suggest that the private hospital was intentionally targeted as part of a larger Syria-Russia offensive that has been increasing in intensity [since the 30 April 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Syria_offensive_(April_2019%E2%80%93present). This attack resulted in 3 people being injured as  [reported](https://smartnews-agency.com/ar/album/383074/%25D8%25AF%25D9%2585%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1-%25D9%2585%25D8%25B4%25D9%2581%25D9%2589-%25D8%25AF%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B1-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D8%25AD%25D9%2583%25D9%2585%25D8%25A9-%25D9%2581%25D9%258A-%25D9%2583%25D9%2581%25D8%25B1%25D9%2586%25D8%25A8%25D9%2584-%25D9%2586%25D8%25AA%25D9%258A%25D8%25AC%25D8%25A9-%25D9%2582%25D8%25B5%25D9%2581-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2586%25D8%25B8%25D8%25A7%25D9%2585%23134721&sa=D&ust=1563107522392000) by SMART news agency, internal and external damage to the building of the hospital, damage to two cars and two electric generator as well as medical equipment according to an interview that was done with the manager of the hospital Dr Ahmad Al Aqraa.

Dr Ahmad Al Aqraa is a cardiologist who graduated from Tishreen military hospital. He is the manager and the owner of Dar Al Hikma Hospital that was built in Kafr Nabl in 1997 and started operating in 2000. The private hospital is officially licensed by the Syrian government.

> He mentioned that Dar Al Hikma hospital was targeted multiple times because we are doing our job in the hospital treating civilians.

The Idlib Health Directorate additionally published a [statement](http://ihd-sy.org/2019/05/28/%D8%B7%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83/) on the attack claiming the hospital was directly targeted by the regime as well as reporting the hospital as destroyed.

According to a local news report released the morning of the attack, Dar Al-Hikma was attacked as a part of several air raids on Kfar Nabl and greater Idlib. Photos and videos showing the damage to the building were uploaded by [citizens,](https://twitter.com/dr_hammady/status/1133309630187220992)  [reporters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZWZTfuG9pY) and [news agencies,](https://smartnews-agency.com/ar/album/383074/%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%83%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%AC%D8%A9-%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85#134721) including [Orient News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYTImxFEg8E), who were on the ground soon after the attack.

Multiple sources confirm Dar al-Hikma as a well-known hospital in Kafr Nabl and Southern Idlib. Local [blog posts](https://syriastories.net/en/resources-overstretched-in-kfar-nabel-hospitals/) as well as activists from early 2015 mention the hospital, and the increasing direness of its operations since attacks on local hospitals intensified. An [article](https://syriastories.net/%25D9%2585%25D8%25B4%25D8%25A7%25D9%2581%25D9%258A-%25D9%2583%25D9%2581%25D8%25B1%25D9%2586%25D8%25A8%25D9%2584-%25D8%25AA%25D8%25B9%25D9%2585%25D9%2584-%25D8%25A8%25D8%25B7%25D8%25A7%25D9%2582%25D8%25AA%25D9%2587%25D8%25A7-%25D8%25A7%25D9%2584%25D9%2582%25D8%25B5%25D9%2588%25D9%2589/) by Syriastories.net from 2015 emphasized the role of the hospital in treating victims of the bombardments in Idlib’s countryside and references the facility as working at “maximum capacity.”

Officially, it is listed as a hospital that is part of the official Syrian Ministry of Health, pictured below.

![](/assets/investigations/daralhikma/image18.png)

Government website lists hospital in directory.

Although it is difficult to confirm the exact date the hospital opened, its name is listed on the public website of the countryside knowledge network that was set up by the Ministry of Local Administration as [early as 2007 as shown](https://web.archive.org/web/20071201012750/http://www.reefnet.gov.sy/ImpInfo/Telephones/health.htm) using the WayBackMachine website. Moreover, an [article](http://esyria.sy/sites/code/index.php?site=idleb&p=stories&category=face&filename=2008060511350431) was published in 2008 profiling the now head of the hospital Dr. Ahmed al-Aqraa mentioning that he started working there since 1996.

# Flight Data Analysis

To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross referenced findings from the media above with flight observation data from a spotter organization. Data for flights around 10:40 near Kafranbel in the Idlib province were more closely analyzed. From the data, the Syrian Archive is able to more confidently confirm the time of the attack. Above the town Kafranabel itself, a Yak 130 (Mitten) was reported as circling the town at around 10:16 preceding an SU-22 (Fitter) which was spotted circling the town at around 10:48. Circling by aircrafts in war zones is common as previous research has found that circling flights typically indicate target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack.

Moreover in the towns of Saraqib and Teftnaz, which neighbor Kafranabel to the north, an SU-24 (Fencer) was spotted flying south from both towns at 10:31 and 10:40. From south of Kafranbel, a SU-24 (Fencer) was identified as flying north at around 10:40. These flight position additionally match reports of Su-22 (Fitter) and SU-24 (Fencer) flying north and north west from Shayrat and T-4 West Airbases in Homs at 10:20-23. The direction and times of these flights corroborates the above investigation of an attack around 10:40 in Kafranbel.

[https://public.tableau.com/profile/syrianarchiveorg#!/vizhome/Observations104028May2019Kafranbel/Sheet1](https://public.tableau.com/profile/syrianarchiveorg%23!/vizhome/Observations104028May2019Kafranbel/Sheet1)

Given that there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircraft was involved in the attack on Kafranbel the presence of these aircrafts above the town as well as neighbouring towns increases the likelihood that an air attack occurred at this location during the times shown and reported on by citizen reporters as well as humanitarian groups, and as estimated using imagery from the attack.

# Injuries as a result of the attack

Dr Ahmad Al Aqraa mentioned in the interview that was done with the Syrian Archive team that three people working in the hospital got injured as a result of this attack. No Casualties were reported.

# De-escalation zone

On May 4 2017, the sponsoring states of Astana Talks (Russia, Turkey and Iran) [signed a memorandum of understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5cF-gIL8yzk) for the establishment of de-escalation zones in Syria which took effect on May 6 2017. The Russian Ministry of Defence [published a map showing](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/Atarib-Market-Bombing.html) the locations included in this memorandum as shown below (de-escalation zones in blue, ISIS in grey, Syrian army in orange). Kafr Nabl town is located within the de-escalation zone.

A month of heavy shelling has ransacked the Idlib governorate, creating a "[humanitarian disaster](https://www.un.org/press/en/2019/sc13826.doc.htm)" in the officially demilitarized zone.

Dar Al-Hikma was one of the last remaining hospitals in the area, after two hospitals were firebombed in Kafr Nabl in one month alone. This includes the Orient hospital, which has [sustained multiple attacks](https://syrianarchive.org/en/investigations/kafrnabel.html) since 2017. The attacks were so intense that the Idlib health directorate released a statement on the 6th of May, pushing operations to an emergency status.

# Repeated Attacks targeting Dar Al Hikma Hospital

Dr Ahmad Al Aqraa (Manager and owner of Dar Al Hikma Hospital) mentioned in an interview conducted with the Syrian Archive team that the hospital was attacked multiple times previously mainly in 2012 during and after clashes between the Syrian army and rebels to get control of the city. Kafar Nabl [got out of the Syrian government control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bxBkDEdK1w) in August 2012. Dr Ahmad mentioned that Dar Al Hikma hospital was one of the main hospitals serving people living in Kafar Nabl and the city around it. At that time, Dar Al Hikma medical staff were treating 50 - 60 injured civilians daily.


# Conclusion

Based on both the open source documentation and flight data featured above, it is confirmed that Dar al-Hikma Hospital was attacked on 28 May 2019 at around 10:40. From this attack, the hospital, which had a history of providing services in the locality since 1996, was destroyed externally and internally rendering it out of service. However, given the limitations of open source data , the Syrian Archive is unable to confirm the perpetrators of the attack although local sources claim it was the Russian or Syrian Air Force.
